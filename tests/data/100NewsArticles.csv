The Senate voted on DeVos""?highly contentious nomination this afternoon, and the tally was split evenly, requiring Pence to use his authority as president of the upper chamber of Congress to break the impasse. This was the first time that a vice president has broken a tie to confirm a Cabinet nominee. Pence read the vote count 50-50 and then voted himself, rendering the tally 51-50. The day before the vote, Democrats staged a 24-hour marathon of speeches, with more than 30 lawmakers taking to the floor to urge at least one additional Republican to vote against DeVos and block her confirmation. ""It is hard to imagine a worse choice,""?Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said before she read letters from constituents urging her to vote no. DeVos stirred up vehement opposition from teachers""?unions and all 48 Senate Democrats. Many cited concerns about her support of school vouchers, which critics believe will weaken public schools, and her lack of experience, since she never attended or worked in the public education system. Others cited her lack of familiarity with a landmark law protecting the education needs of disabled children.     She was panned for a gaffe during her confirmation hearing, when she hedged on an answer about guns in schools by saying they might be needed in states like Wyoming to defend against ""potential grizzlies.""?DeVos' nomination drew above-average negative reactions from the public, with voters flooding Senate phone lines and email accounts in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said his office received 14,000 calls about DeVos. In addition to the entire Democratic caucus, two moderate Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced they would not support DeVos. During a speech announcing her opposition, Collins said DeVos""?focus on charters and vouchers ""raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education's primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools.""?Before the confirmation vote, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted along party lines, 12-11, to refer DeVos""?nomination to the full Senate.

2,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/melania-trump-white-house-millions-brand-45327337,Melania Trump Says White House Could Mean Millions for Brand,,"First lady Melania Trump has said little about what she intends to do with her prominent position. But in new court documents, her lawyers say that the ""multi-year term"" during which she ""is one of the most photographed women in the world"" could mean millions of dollars for her personal brand. While the new documents don't specifically mention her term as first lady, the unusual statement about her expected profits drew swift condemnation from ethics watchdogs as inappropriate profiteering from her high-profile position, which is typically centered on public service. The statement came Monday in a libel lawsuit the first lady re-filed in a state trial court in Manhattan. Trump has been suing the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail's website over a now-retracted report that claimed she once worked as an escort. In the filing Monday, Trump's lawyers argued that the report was not only false and libelous, but also damaged her ability to profit off her high profile and affected her business opportunities. Trump ""had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model, brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world,"" the lawsuit said. The products could have included apparel, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care and fragrance, among others, the suit says. The first lady is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million. Richard Painter, who advised former President George W. Bush on ethics, said the language in the lawsuit shows Melania Trump is engaging ""in an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain. This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money. That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress."" Painter is part of a group of attorneys suing the president for an alleged violation of a constitutional clause that prohibits presidents from receiving foreign gifts or payments. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Charles Harder, Melania Trump's attorney, said ""the first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted."" Harder did not respond to a follow-up question about what the lawsuit means by ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."" To Painter and others, there is no ambiguity. ""She's not talking about the future,"" Painter said. ""She's talking about earning money now."" Scott Amey, general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight, said it is ""another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests."" Trump previously filed the lawsuit against Mail Media Inc. in Maryland, but a judge earlier this month ruled the case was filed in the wrong court. The lawsuit is now filed in New York, where the corporation has offices. Trump also had sued blogger Webster Tarpley for reporting the unsubstantiated rumors. Trump filed the lawsuit in Maryland after both Tarpley and the Daily Mail issued retractions. On Tuesday, Melania Trump's attorneys said they'd settled the Maryland case against Tarpley. ""Mr. Tarpley has issued the attached retraction and apology to Mrs. Trump and her family, and agreed to pay her a substantial sum as a settlement,"" Harder's office said in a statement. Melania Trump's previous work in marketing has drawn scrutiny before. On Inauguration Day, the official White House biography for Melania Trump originally included an explicit reference to her jewelry collection, which it noted was sold on the home-shopping channel QVC. By the next day, that bio had been edited and simplified to say that she had ""launched her own jewelry collection."" A spokeswoman for the first lady said the website was updated out of ""an abundance of caution"" and that the jewelry line is no longer available in any case. President Donald Trump continues to financially benefit from his global business empire, breaking from past practice. Previous presidents and their families have divested from business interests and placed their holdings in a blind trust, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Trump handed daily management of the real estate, property management and licensing to his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization employee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-fears-fraud-gop-eliminates-election-commission-45328264,"As Trump Fears Fraud, GOP Eliminates Election Commission",,"A House committee voted on Tuesday to eliminate an independent election commission charged with helping states improve their voting systems as President Donald Trump erroneously claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The party-line vote came less than two days after Trump vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his accusations of election fraud. ""We're going to look at it very, very carefully,"" Trump said of voter fraud in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday. ""It has to do with the registration, and when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted."" Reports that Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting last month that 3 to 5 million ballots were cast illegally during the 2016 race were met with discomfort on Capitol Hill. While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they haven't pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for congressional leadership. The vote in the House Administration Committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party's rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators. Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste. They've been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success. ""If we're looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,"" said Rep. Gregg Harper, the committee chairman. ""We don't need fluff."" Harper said he hadn't spoken to Trump about the legislation. ""He's certainly welcome to call me at any time,"" he said. The bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference. ""At a time when the vast majority of the country's voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,"" said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice. The committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14 million in the general election. But by accepting the grant, a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign. President Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign's spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year. Money for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers' returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes. The legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction. It is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-decide-challenge-trumps-immigration-executive-order/story?id=45325524,Appeals Court to Decide on Challenge to Trump's Immigration Executive Order,,"This afternoon, three federal judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in the emergency legal challenge to President Trump's executive order that temporarily bars immigration and travel to the U.S. for people from seven Muslim-majority countries and for refugees. The hearing, which will be conducted over the phone at 3 p.m. Pacific time, will allow each side to give 30-minute arguments. The plaintiffs in this appeal, Washington and Minnesota, will state their case, as will the Department of Justice. The public can listen to the hearings live on the 9th Circuit website. The judges are expected to rule on the future of the executive order after hearing oral arguments. While their decision won't determine the constitutionality of Trump's immigration ban, it will determine whether the suspension of the executive order, ruled by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, will remain. The two states have argued that Trump's order was likely to cause ""irreparable harm"" to businesses, schools, family relations and state residents' freedom to travel and is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of religion. The Justice Department said the travel restrictions are a matter of national security and the administration was excluding people from countries with ties to terrorism, not people of a certain religion.     Today, Trump suggested that the legal battle between the two states and the Justice Department could make it all the way to the Supreme Court. ""We're going to take it through the system,"" said Trump. ""It's very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date."" On Capitol Hill today, Secretary of >Homeland Security John Kelly defended the immigration executive order, calling it ""lawful and constitutional."" Only a week old, the order has sparked protests and outcry across the country. The legal community has been grappling with the order, some travelers have been delayed, and others are wondering if they will be allowed previously approved entry into the United States. The order, called Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, bars all people with immigrant and nonimmigrant visas from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for 90 days. It also prevents the entry of refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, with an indefinite ban on refugees from the war-torn country of Syria. The Monday after Trump signed his order, Washington state filed a legal challenge that was joined by Minnesota. Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, on Friday issued a temporary restraining order, which covers the entire U.S., blocking the travel ban. Trump immediately took issue with the move, tweeting on Saturday, ""The opinion of this so-called judge ... is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" On Saturday the Department of Justice, challenging Robart's ruling, turned to the powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to try to immediately lift the restraining order while the appeal was being considered. The appeals court denied the request. The outcome of today's hearing with the 9th Circuit could determine ""?at least temporarily ""?the fate of thousands of refugees, immigrants and travelers in the United States and abroad hoping to enter the U.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tornadoes were reported in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Donaldsonville, Ponchatoula and Killian, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. Tornado watches were in effect for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The tornado watch in Louisiana and Mississippi expired after 2 p.m., when the storms moved east, Griffin said. The tornado watch in Alabama and Florida is set to expire at 6 p.m. Severe storms are expected in cities such as Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile and Pensacola. There could still be isolated and severe storms in North and South Carolina. As of Tuesday morning, at least 23 U.S. states were under winter weather alerts, and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the Southeast as most of the country braces for severe weather this week. ""We are in a very active weather pattern all across the country, from California to New York,""?ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. An atmospheric river, which draws massive amounts of water vapor from the Pacific Ocean, has taken aim at California, where the National Weather Service has issued flash flood and flood watches through Friday.   Copious rainfall is in the forecast for the West Coast until the end of the week, potentially bringing floods, mudslides and debris flows. ABC News""?weather team predicts more than a half a foot of rain in Central to Northern California over the next several days. Additional rain is expected for Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. ""California will see waves of moisture on and off through Friday,""?Golembo said.   Meanwhile, thunderstorms and damaging winds are expected to rattle Southern states, from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. The National Weather System has issued a tornado watch for portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and other parts of the region's coast until 2 p.m. local time. ""severe storms are firing up already in Louisiana and Mississippi,""?Golembo said. ""damaging winds are the biggest threat this morning.""?  Northeastern states can expect to see rain, snow and ice this week, according to ABC News meteorologists. The first of two storms arrives today, bringing rain and ice for much of the region, with potential snowfall in Boston and other parts of New England. The icy weather moved through the Hudson Valley into southern New England this morning. By this afternoon, the snow and ice in Boston will transition to heavy rain, with some snow and ice lingering in New England and the upper Hudson Valley near Albany, New York.   ABC News meteorologists said a second storm will move into the Northeast on Thursday morning, bringing mostly snow to New York City and Boston. Heavy snowfall is in the forecast until Thursday afternoon. Some weather models are showing snow farther south in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. ""This could be a plowed event for major Northeast cities,""?Golembo said. ""stay tuned. This is a changing forecast.""?

The attack took place in front of dozens of backpackers at a hostel in northern Queensland. Ayliffe-Chung was found dead at the scene. Jackson tried to stop the attack and was fatally wounded.

Last week, after Iran tested a ballistic missile, Trump tweeted that the country was ""playing with fire,"" saying they ""don't appreciate how 'kind' President (Barack) Obama was to them. Not me!"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who makes the final decisions on all major policies in Iran, appeared to respond to the tweet in a remarks carried by State TV. ""Why should we be thankful to the previous U.S. administration?"" he said. ""Because it imposed anti-Iranian sanctions? Because of the extremist Islamic State group?

He went on to mock Trump, saying: ""We are thankful to Mr. Newcomer, of course, since he has shown the real face of the U.S. and proved what Iran has said for 38 years about the political, economic, social and moral corruption of the U.S. government."" He added that the Iranian people ""are not afraid of any threat."" Trump has repeatedly criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers, in which Tehran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions, but he has not said what he plans to do about it. His administration said Iran was ""on notice"" over the missile test, and imposed new sanctions on more than two dozen Iranian companies and individuals. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who has worked to improve relations with the West, said earlier Tuesday that the nuclear agreement could serve as a blueprint for resolving other Middle East disputes. As an example, he pointed to Russian-led negotiations in Kazakhstan aimed at firming up a shaky Syrian cease-fire and paving the way for the revival of peace talks to end that country's nearly six-year civil war.

U.S. Marshals from across the country, along with bloodhounds and helicopters, are taking part in the search, officials said this morning. ""We have a killer in our midst,"" said Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan.     The first reported crime was on Jan. 31, in Santa Rosa County, Florida, when Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Moore, 39, were found shot to death at an inn, Morgan said.

11,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/flu-takes-toll-nyc-children-reported-dead-seasonal/story?id=45320883,Flu Takes a Toll in NYC With 4 Children Reported Dead in Seasonal Outbreak,,"The flu season has been particularly rough in New York City this year with four pediatric deaths from the virus reported in the city, all in January, according to New York State Health Department. The flu has been spreading across the country, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention seeing epidemic levels of flu activity late last month. There have been 15 flu-related pediatric deaths in the nation during this current flu season, the CDC reported last week. New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania all reported high levels of flu-like activity, according to a CDC flu report last week. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said while the deaths are tragic, the New York cases are not unusual for the flu season. The New York State Department of Health did not disclose the ages of the children or whether they had been vaccinated or had an underlying condition that would have put them at additional risk for complications. ""Every year in our pediatric emergency room come children who are otherwise clearly healthy and they are seriously ill with the flu,"" Schaffner said of Vanderbilt. ""The lesson is that flu can strike even healthy children."" During the previous flu season, a total of 89 pediatric deaths related to the flu virus were reported in the U.S., according to the CDC.     Public health experts have been concerned about vaccination rates since pediatricians may have had difficulty getting some children to get vaccinated against the flu if they have an aversion to needles, Schaffner noted. While in the past doctors could vaccinate needle-averse children with a flu mist vaccine, they were advised not to use the flu nasal spray this year, since it was found less effective than a vaccine injection. ""It's clear that the substantial majority of children who die from influenza every year have not been vaccinated,"" Schaffner said, clarifying that he was speaking generally and not about the recent deaths in New York. Flu can cause symptoms of headache, fever, joint pain and cough. The seasonal flu generally spreads across the U.S. from November till March, with the peak number of cases often occurring in February. The number of people affected every year can vary widely, but generally, the CDC reports that ""millions of people are sickened, hundreds of thousands are hospitalized and thousands or tens of thousands of people die from flu every year."" Children under the age of 1 are at increased likelihood of developing complications if they contract the flu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an address to Parliament, President Klaus Iohannis, a critic of the two-month-old government, said the majority of Romanians now believed the country was going in the wrong direction. ""Romania needs a government that is transparent, which governs predictably by the light of day, not sneakily at night,"" the president said, referring to the late hour the government passed an emergency ordinance last week aimed at decriminalizing some forms of official corruption. The move ""?which bypassed Parliament and was not signed off by Iohannis, who has limited powers ""?ignited the biggest protests seen since communism ended in the country in 1989. As a result, the government will now seek to introduce the plan in Parliament. Thousands gathered for the eighth consecutive evening in Victory Square outside the government offices, shouting ""Social Democratic Party, the red plague!"" and ""Resign!"" In smaller numbers, about 2,000 protesters gathered outside the presidential palace yelling ""Get out, you traitor!"" Iohannis, who was elected in 2014 by direct vote, was chairman of the opposition Liberal Party. He quit the party that year to stand as president. He has been critical of the government headed by Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, which came into being after the December parliamentary elections. The government ""has been saying publicly I can't stomach the result of the vote ... that I'd overturn a legitimate government,"" Iohannis said. ""That's false. You won, now govern and legislate, but not at any price."" Some lawmakers booed and shouted ""shame on you!"" at Iohannis and walked out. Other lawmakers cheered. Despite the crisis, Iohannis said Romania didn't need early elections, a view the government shares. Liviu Dragnea, chairman of the governing Social Democratic Party, and Senate speaker Calin Popescu Tariceanu refused to greet the president when he arrived at Parliament. In his speech, Iohannis pressed ahead with an earlier initiative to hold a referendum on another government initiative to pardon prisoners. Critics say the proposal will help government allies convicted of corruption. Dragnea, the main power broker behind the government, expressed disappointment Iohannis did not deliver a ""speech of unity,"" and said ""he should leave the government alone, to govern.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He argued that the order, which blocks travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country, ""will prevail [in court] and be able to take the steps necessary to protect our nation.""     Kelly repeatedly disputed that the executive order is a Muslim ban, insisting it's just a ""pause"" based on security concerns. He said five of the seven countries named in the order are ""nearly failed states"" and four of them don't have U.S. embassies. ""So I'm at a total loss to understand how we can vet people from various countries when in at least four of those countries we don't even have an embassies,"" he said. Earlier in the hearing, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Kelly to provide information on any ""bad people"" who have been let into the U.S. since a court halted the executive order. ""Let's just say, for instance, a person who is trying to get to the United States to do some harm, some terrorist attack, is coming in during this period that the courts put a stay on our enforcement. We won't know that until an individual who's a bad person, until they do something bad,"" Kelly said. ""But it's entirely possible that someone that's coming in, whether it's during this stay court action or previous to this, they intend to do us harm."" ""But you don't have any proof at this point?"" Thompson followed up. ""Not until the boom,"" Kelly said. When asked to clarify, Kelly responded, ""Not until they act to blow something up or go into a mall and kill people."" He continued, ""The vetting on the other end, in those seven countries, are suspect. And Mr. Trump, and certainly in my view, we have to do a pause, which he ordered. Now is under court action, so that we can take a look at what we're doing on the other end. I believe the vetting on the other end right now is not adequate to protect the nation.""

Although she later said she misspoke, the Feb. 2 interview wasn""t the first time Conway made the reference. Cosmopolitan.com is reporting that she also made inaccurate comments about attacks in Bowling Green as early as Sunday, Jan. 29, when she said President Barack Obama implemented a similar action in 2011. ""He did. It's a fact,""?Conway said in remarks not initially published by Cosmopolitan.com. ""Why did he do that? He did that for exactly the same reasons. He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers""?lives away.""?And in a Jan. 29 interview with TMZ, Conway said two Iraqi men were the ""masterminds""?behind a ""Bowling Green attack""?on American troops. ""President Obama suspended the Iraq refugee program for six months in 2011, and no one certainly covered ""?I think nobody noticed,""?she told TMZ. ""He did that because, I assume, there were two Iraqis who came here, got radicalized, joined ISIS and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers.""?In response to criticism of her citing a nonexistent Bowling Green attack or massacre, Conway released a statement, explaining that she misspoke. ""I meant to say masterminds or terrorists and not massacre,""?Conway said in the statement. ""It does not detract from the evil they perpetrated and the evil that others may wish to perpetrate if they lie about why they are here.""?Her comments about Bowling Green began garnering attention shortly after her interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews aired Thursday night. ""I bet it's brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,""?Conway told Matthews. ""Tost people don""t know that because it didn""t get covered.""? She later said she was referring to the ""Bowling Green terrorists""?ABC News first reported on in 2013.  On @hardball @NBCNews @MSNBC I meant to say ""Bowling Green terrorists"" as reported here: https://t.co/nB5SwIEoYI  The story was about two Iraqi refugees who plotted to attack Americans and who later admitted in court to attacking U.S. troops in Iraq. The two refugees lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky, but they never committed a massacre or any attacks in Bowling Green, as Conway said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We have seen what happened in Paris, Nice, all over Europe,"" Trump said while speaking at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida in his address to U.S. service members. ""It has gotten to a point where it is not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press does not want to report it."" Trump did not specify any particular incidents that had been omitted from coverage. ""They [the press] have their reasons, and you understand that,"" he said. During a subsequent press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared to double down on the president's claim, saying there were several instances of the media under-reporting terrorist attacks. ""There's a lot of instances that have occurred where I don't think they've gotten the coverage it's deserved and I think that's what the president was clearly referring to there,"" Spicer said. Spicer did not offer any specific examples at the time, but said he believed that while some attacks or foiled attacks ""barely [get] coverage,"" extensive reporting has been done on some protests against the Trump administration. Included in a list of attacks that the White House provided Monday evening were the Paris attacks in November 2015, San Bernardino, in December 2015, Brussels in March 2016 and Nice, France in July 2016. Those incidents, each with multiple casualties, were among dozens of attacks the White House listed between September 2014 and December 2016. ""The point here is that these terrorist attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,"" a White House spokesperson said. During his brief remarks at the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, the president seemed to make reference to his executive order banning immigration and visas from seven Muslim-majority nations that is currently the subject of a number of legal challenges. ""We need strong programs,"" he said, adding that ""people that want to destroy us and want to destroy our country"" must be kept out. Trump went on to defend NATO while simultaneously saying members of the alliance were not making ""full and proper contributions."" Echoing President Ronald Reagan, Trump said the U.S. military should be guided by the mantra ""Peace Through Strength,"" before repeating his campaign refrain ""America First.""

Says",,"The Texas Rangers are joining the search for the jersey worn by New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady in last night's historic Super Bowl game. Brady's jersey was allegedly stolen from the Patriots locker room after the Super Bowl in Houston, according to a statement from Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who said he asked the Texas Rangers to help the Houston Police look for it. ""Tom Brady's jersey has great historical value and is already being called 'the most valuable NFL collectible ever,"" Patrick said in a statement. ""It will likely go into the Hall of Fame one day. It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas. I""ve called Colonel Steve McCraw to ask that the Texas Rangers work with the Houston Police Department on this case."" ""I'm a Texans and Cowboys fan first,"" Patrick said, ""but the unquestionable success of the Super Bowl in Houston last night was a big win for our entire state and I don""t want anything to mar that victory. Whoever took this jersey should turn it in. The Texas Rangers are on the trail."" The intrigue surrounding Brady's missing jersey began last night after the Patriots' historic win, when Brady was seen on video telling Patriots owner Robert Kraft that his game jersey was stolen. The Patriots said Brady's jersey and pads were taken off the field before the trophy ceremony Sunday night, Boston station FOX25 reported Monday morning; it appears the jersey disappeared at some point after that. This clarified an earlier Fox25 report that a team equipment manager had locked the jersey up. This morning, Brady told reporters he is still missing the jersey, saying he put it in his bag Sunday night and later it was gone. ""If it shows up on eBay somewhere, someone let me know,"" Brady said this morning. ""It's unfortunate, because that's a nice piece of memorabilia,"" Brady said. ""Those are pretty special ones to keep ... What can you do? I'll take the ring and that's good enough for me."" Brady, who was named Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl for the fourth time, accepted the MVP trophy from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell with smiles at the press conference this morning.   Goodell had suspended Brady for the first four games of the 2016 season for his alleged involvement in the deflation of footballs during the 2015 AFC championship game. Last night marked the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history as the Patriots erased a 25-point deficit, beating the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime. It was also a record fifth Super Bowl win for Brady. Brady said at a press conference this morning of the Falcons, ""I give them a lot of credit. They're a great football team.""     ""It took a lot of great plays for us to overcome the deficit and the hole that we dug. But we were able to do it,"" Brady said. Brady said the Patriots ""faced a lot of adversities"" this year and he called their stunning victory a ""great way to really culminate the season."" ""It took a kind of miraculous effort to do it,"" he said, adding that he's ""happy that we were able to get it accomplished.""       Brady said ""it was great"" to celebrate at the Super Bowl with his mother, who has been ill and missed all of this season's games. ""She's been through a lot. Way harder than what I went through last night ... and my dad's been there every step of the way. They set such a great example for me,"" Brady said. Now that the big game is over, Brady said he's looking to spending time with his children, who he said will be happy to see the trophy.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News after visiting her comatose husband in a Moscow hospital, Evgenia Kara-Murza said, ""�[Trump] must know that such people as Vladimir Putin are not friends. And they cannot be dealt with on friendly terms.""?Her husband, 35-year-old Vladimir Kara-Murza, an outspoken critic of Putin, remains in critical condition, fighting for his life, she said. His doctors say he was poisoned by an unknown substance, she added. The activist was hospitalized on Thursday shortly after feeling ill; within hours, most of his major organs were failing. It is the second time in two years that he was poisoned; the first time, in 2015, left the father of three with nerve damage that left him walking with cane. Evgenia Kara-Murza said that she does not know who is behind the poisoning but that she believes it can only be related to his work. A veteran opposition campaigner, he has appeared repeatedly before the U.S. Congress, pressing for it to impose sanctions on Russian officials involved in human rights abuse.

""This is straight out of the old KBG playbook, and it's death by poison.""?Two years ago this month, Boris Nemtsov, a prominent opposition leader in Russia and longtime critic of Putin, was shot to death on a Moscow bridge.

""The State argues...that the injunction does not impose any irreparable harm. But the injunction reinstates procedures that the President determined should be temporarily suspended in the interest of national security,"" the reply brief to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, filed Monday evening, says. ""The potential national-security risks and harms resulting from the compelled application of procedures that the President has determined must be reexamined, for the purpose of ensuring an adequate measure of protection for the Nation, cannot be undone. Nor can the effect on our constitutional separation of powers."" The DOJ also called Washington state Federal Judge James Robart's action ""lastly overbroad, extending far beyond the State's legal claims to encompass numerous applications of the Order that the State does not even attempt to argue are unlawful.""?Today, the appeals court scheduled oral arguments in the case for 3 p.m. PT on Feb. 7. On Friday, Robart agreed with the states of Washington and Minnesota that Trump's executive order -- which curtailed immigration and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries -- was likely to ""go cause irreparable harm""?to businesses, schools, family relations, and state residents""?freedom to travel and issued a nationwide temporary restraining order blocking most parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed to the 9th Circuit late Saturday night arguing that the president is acting within his authority and that the ruling by Robart ""second-guesses the President's national security judgment.""?Early Sunday morning, the 9th Circuit rejected the DOJ's request for an emergency stay on the restraining order. Washington state's lawsuit received support from major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Facebook, as well as former secretaries of state and national security officials.

21,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/betsy-devos-senate-vote/index.html,Betsy DeVos confirmed as education secretary, vice president casts historic tie-breaking vote,Washington (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence cast a historic tie-breaking vote Tuesday to confirm Betsy DeVos as the next education secretary after the Senate was evenly divided over the controversial pick.,"The 51-50 vote ends Trump's toughest confirmation battle yet. Senate Democrats debated through the night and into Tuesday morning in a last-ditch attempt to derail DeVos, buoyed by support from Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Throughout the fight, Democrats argued they needed ""Just one more!"" to lure away another Republican vote. But Senate Republican leaders succeeded in delivering a victory to Trump in a confirmation fight that very few expected to become as tough as it did. DeVos' poor performance in her confirmation hearing -- punctuated by her suggestion that a school in Wyoming might want to have guns on premises to protect against grizzly bears -- contributed to roaring anger among public school supporters and teachers unions. Even before her hearing, critics pointed to DeVos's lack of experience with public schools and her bankrolling of efforts like school vouchers that could take money from public institutions. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer voiced his displeasure with the vote moments after she was confirmed, tweeting, ""Today @VP Mike Pence did something no one else has ever done: cast the tie breaking vote on his own cabinet nominee."" Devos tweeted after the vote, ""I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students."" Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN earlier Tuesday that DeVos seemed to have no knowledge of the federal law that protects students with disabilities. ""You put those two things together, lack of compassion for what's happened to places like Sandy Hook and an inability to just understand the basic law around vulnerable students and it was clear at the end of that hearing that this was someone who shouldn't be the secretary of education,"" the Connecticut Democrat said. DeVos' Senate vote comes after a dramatic 24 hours of protest from Democrats inside and outside the Capitol that lasted through the night, into Tuesday morning, with Democratic senators taking shifts in the Senate arguing against DeVos. The delay tactics have succeeded in stalling many of Trump's most important Cabinet picks -- but Senate Republican leaders promised Monday to get votes for four nominees this week: DeVos, Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price, Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin and attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more questions have been raised about Trump's Cabinet picks. Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder admitted Monday to hiring an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper. But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn promised to overcome Democratic tactics with long hours at the Capitol -- including the possibility of working through Saturday.

23,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/05/opinions/devos-racism-public-school-opinion-wong/index.html,A vote for DeVos is a vote for resegregation,"Felicia Wong is President and CEO of the Roosevelt Institute, an economic and social policy think tank working to re-imagine the rules so they work for all Americans, and co-author of the forthcoming book ""Rewrite the Racial Rules: Building an Inclusive American Economy."" Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers, is on Roosevelt's board. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.","The limited scope of DeVos' education policy experience has raised questions for many about whether she is suited to run the federal agency charged with making American public education first-rate for all children. But there is another subterranean element to this debate, which now should be surfaced, especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics. Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K-12 education almost 50 years ago, and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling, public and private, today. DeVos' track record suggests that as secretary, she will do little to combat these trends. In the wake of the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal, the federal government began -- albeit slowly -- to desegregate. This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation. The backlash, now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today, was fierce. From Alabama Governor George Wallace's stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of ""segregation now, segregation forever"" to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement, the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics. But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools. Thus, an estimated half-million white students left public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in schools that were known as ""segregation academies."" This move to private schools was part of a larger ""white flight"" movement. White flight was one of the greatest demographic shifts in American history. Millions of whites nationwide moved out of cities and into racially isolated suburbs. Scholar Kevin Kruse has called white flight ""the most successful segregationist response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts."" The character and quality of most American schools today, like the neighborhoods in which they are found and which they shape, have a racial past. Now, American public schools are falling back into a kind of racial segregation that is reminiscent of our country before Brown. In the last 25 years, the number of severely racially isolated schools, defined as those with 0-10% white students, has tripled. In 2010 in New York City, 92% of black students and 88% of Latino students attended schools that were majority-minority, some of which see such severely racialized and concentrated poverty that they are dubbed ""apartheid schools."" In DeVos's own state of Michigan, which has seen two decades of charter school growth, enrollment and funding for public schools has waned while schools have become increasingly segregated. Nor does public funding for private schools, which DeVos advocates, seem to achieve much good for students of color. Voucher and other public funding programs are marketed as appealing because tax dollars ""follow the child."" But research over the past fifteen years shows that private schools are even more racially segregated than public schools. This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color. Research shows that both black children who attend desegregated schools end up with more income, higher wages and better long-term health, with no negative effects on white students. Further, a range of studies strongly suggest that desegregated schools educate all children such that they can better contribute to American society and to a healthier American economy. It is therefore both a moral outrage and an economic mistake that so much of the current movement in favor of school choice and religious education carries the stain of racial animosity, even in dog-whistle form. Of course, many private and religious schools are excellent and inclusive places of learning. But let's not be fooled. School choice is not really about freedom. Freedom, of course, is a bedrock American value. But the kind of ""freedom"" associated with the flight away from integration and toward racial isolation will never lead to a more truly free United States. So as senators consider DeVos' nomination to oversee public education for every American child, they would do well to remember the deepest values of public schooling, as well as the deeper meaning of appointing a Secretary of Education associated with a more exclusive and racially exclusionary vision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/iran-khamenei-trump-comments/index.html,"Trump 'shows true face of US,' says Iran's Supreme Leader","(CNN)Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday that he's grateful to President Donald Trump for showing ""the true face of the US.""","Khamenei told a gathering of Iran's air force commanders in Tehran that the new US administration has shown the world ""the depth of corruption in US government,"" according to quotes published by Iran's semi-official MEHR news agency. Khamenei reportedly told the commanders: ""We however thank this new guy in the White House, since he largely did the job we had been trying to do in the past decades: to divulge the true face of the US. We had been working to show the world the depth of corruption in US government and ranks and files of the ruling elite; Trump did it in few days after coming to the White House."" He added: ""Their claims to human rights are no longer tenable."" Khamenei also made an apparent reference to the five-year-old son of an Iranian mother who was detained at a US airport following Trump's ban on visas for seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. According to Iran's official news agency, IRNA, the Ayatollah said: ""Presently, too, by embarking on such actions, like putting handcuffs on a five-year-old kid, he [Trump] is demonstrating the reality behind the American human rights."" Khamenei's comments come amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US since Trump became president. The travel ban and sanctions enacted by the Trump administration, coupled with missile testing by Iran, have contributed to the deteriorating relationship. Concerns have been raised over the future of a deal, brokered by the Obama administration, that requires Iran to heavily restrict its nuclear program. On Saturday, a day after the Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions over an Iranian ballistic missile test, US Defense Secretary James Mattis called Iran ""the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world."" Two days earlier, Trump had tweeted that ""Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE"" and should have been ""thankful"" for the ""terrible deal"" brokered by the Obama administration. He declined to rule out military action against Iran. But a senior Iranian adviser to the Ayatollah, Ali Akbar Velayati, dismissed Trump's remarks as ""baseless ranting."" And this is not the first time that the Ayatollah has spoken in such terms about the US President. In November, during the election race, Khamenei lambasted both Trump and Hillary Clinton for revealing what he called the moral shortcomings of the US.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/yemen-raid-al-qaeda/index.html,Al Qaeda leader mocks Trump after Yemen raid,"(CNN)Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President.","In an 11-minute recording, AQAP leader Qassim al-Rimi condemned the January 29 raid, saying, ""The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face."" The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed ""dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,"" a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William ""Ryan"" Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week's raid. Trump is using Obama as a security blanket Civilian deaths Reportedly among the dead was the 8-year-old the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late US-born cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a London-based nongovernmental organization, and a Sanaa-based human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. ""When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,"" Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn't the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi. In the event Rimi wasn't there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said. Green-lighting the mission was not dependent on al-Rimi being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized. But US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, had strongly disputed that Rimi was the objective of the raid more than a week ago. ""It wasn't a high-value target mission,"" Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a ""high possibility"" Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an intelligence-gathering operation. ""Anyone found on site would have been taken,"" Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid. The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid Raid missteps Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. On Friday, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid but later pulled them because the video was nearly a decade old. Government officials previously told CNN plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that Trump green-lighted the mission shortly after his inauguration. How Donald Trump's first military action went from the Obama White House to deadly raid The Pentagon said the battle resulted in the deaths of 14 al Qaeda fighters, including two AQAP leaders. Many observers have considered al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula among the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, branch of al Qaeda since its formation in 2009. Rimi reportedly became its leader following a 2015 drone strike that killed Nasir al-Wuhayshi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/trump-japan-shinzo-abe-mar-a-lago/index.html,Trump teeing up a softer diplomatic approach with Japan,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump is turning on the charm. Or at least, he's turning on his golf cart.","After a combative round of telephone diplomacy with even the staunchest US allies, the commander in chief is planning a more genial approach this week when he decamps with Japan's Prime Minister to his winter getaway in Florida for a round of golf. He's not likely to instruct Shinzo Abe how to dance the Cotton-Eyed Joe, the way George W. Bush did when Vladimir Putin visited his Crawford, Texas, ranch. Nor is he hoping to replicate the courtside bro-out Barack Obama enjoyed with David Cameron at a March Madness game in Ohio. But in bringing Abe to his ornate southern retreat Mar-a-Lago, Trump is nonetheless continuing a long tradition of presidents melding recreation and negotiation in their encounters with foreign leaders. Trump, who is still seeking his diplomatic footing three weeks into his term, finds himself more relaxed at his oceanfront oasis than in the White House, where he's lived for less than a month. He hopes the gesture will also put the buttoned-up Abe at ease. ""That's the one thing about golf -- you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch,"" Trump told a radio interviewer over the weekend. The President has told aides he hopes to use golf and visits to Mar-a-Lago as a way to develop warmer ties with his foreign counterparts, many of whom are approaching his presidency with uncertainty. Trump, who prefers to sleep in his own bed, has expressed little interest so far in traveling abroad, though he's committed to attending a European NATO summit in May and accepted an invitation from Britain's Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit this summer. RELATED: Theresa May in trouble over Trump's UK state visit invite At Mar-a-Lago, Trump is happy to play host. Overlooking the Atlantic on Florida's Gold Coast, the club is firmly Trump's turf. On his first trip there as president last weekend, he mingled in the club's living room with paying members even as a Washington state judge halted his controversial immigration order. Friends say Trump is most relaxed in the confines of his estate -- or playing golf on the courses he owns nearby. ""He's able to relax on the golf course with people he knows and trusts and likes,"" said Robin Bernstein, one of Mar-a-Lago's original members, who speaks with Trump frequently when he's staying in Florida. ""I think that he finds golf kind of his outlet to relax. He loves it, he enjoys it, he's a fabulous athlete, and that's what he loves. Some people go fishing -- Donald loves golf."" In Abe, Trump finds a leader eager to foster a closer bond with the US, particularly given Trump's tough criticism of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Japan was a partner in, and the costs of US security support provided to the East Asian nation. ""This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday after detailing the weekend trip. Abe enjoyed a congenial working relationship with Obama, but the two men never developed warm personal ties. When Abe tried bringing Obama to Tokyo's best sushi restaurant in 2014, the US president grew restless as the dinner stretched for hours. Abe is hoping to start fresh with Trump, already meeting once with the real estate mogul in November. The pair discussed bilateral ties in Trump's Louis XIV-style livingroom at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Abe brought along a gold-colored golf driver as a gift. ""I know he loves the game, and we're going to have a lot of fun,"" Trump said in the radio interview this week. ""I'll just make sure he's my partner."" Trump's invitation for a weekend at his private club continues a well-established practice of vacation diplomacy for US presidents. His predecessors have acted both as hosts for their foreign counterparts and as guests at vacation spots and golf courses the world over. But no recent president has owned as lavish a getaway home as Trump, or been so eager to show it off. Obama, who maintained a residence in Chicago but rarely visited there himself, employed public properties instead to host foreign leaders away from the White House. Obama invited the new Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Sunnylands estate in Southern California for their first meeting, including a long ramble in scalding desert heat around the grounds. He used Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, to reassure Arab Gulf leaders of his Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Accustomed to more lavish environs, leaders like Saudi King Salman sent top advisers instead. More relaxing were his encounters with Cameron. After Obama flew him to Dayton for the NCAA tournament in 2012, Cameron reciprocated with a round of golf at the Grove Club in Hertfordshire. He was one of the few foreign leaders who joined Obama for golf -- others included the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia. Bush, who swore off golf shortly after the start of the Iraq War, hosted more than a dozen leaders among the scrub brush at his Crawford ranch. His three-day summit there with Putin in 2001 featured line dancing and a barbecue, but little agreement on missile defense. A session with the Saudi King resulted in some awkward photos of the President holding the Gulf monarch's hand. Bill Clinton used Camp David to try securing an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat at the end of his term. He wasn't successful; the wooded retreat proved less inspiring than it had 20 years earlier, when Jimmy Carter brokered a successful peace accord there between Israel and Egypt. Like Trump, Clinton identified golf as an entry point into personal relationships with counterparts. A round in 2000 with Singapore's Prime Minister in Brunei started late and stretched well past midnight. American leaders aren't alone in using quieter retreats as a setting for talks. When Obama visited Saudi Arabia in 2014, then-King Abdullah received him at his desert getaway oasis, Rawdat Khurayim, 35 miles outside Riyadh. Trump, too, could soon find himself at another leader's vacation home when he travels to Britain -- though not necessarily to make him more comfortable. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, suggested this week that Trump's visit to the United Kingdom may take place at Balmoral, the Queen's Scotland estate, to evade the expected masses of protesters in London. The palace later tamped down that speculation, noting the Aberdeenshire castle was privately owned by the royal family, and thus unsuitable for a state visit. But of the Queen's other official residences, two -- Windsor Castle, outside London, and Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh -- would at least move Trump away from the capital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/white-house-terror-attack-list-trump/index.html,Journalists call out White House claims on terror reporting,(CNN)Journalists are calling out a White House claim that news outlets are failing to adequately report terror attacks.,"On Monday, the White House issued a list of 78 terror attacks to underscore President Donald Trump's assertion that the media is failing to adequately report them. Trump told enlisted service-members at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that attacks were happening ""all over Europe"" and that ""it's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported."" ""And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,"" Trump added. Later, the White House distributed a list of the attacks Trump was citing, saying ""most did not receive adequate attention."" ""Below is a list of 78 major terrorist attacks targeting the West that were executed or inspired by ISIS since September 2014, soon after the terror group declared its caliphate. Most of these attacks did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources,"" a White House official said on background, when distributing the list. But reporters in print, on air and on social media have robustly covered many of those attacks and terror in general. ""As a journalist I'm really troubled by that,"" Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said on CNN's ""The Lead"" on Monday, responding to Trump's initial statement. ""We have brave colleagues who everyday are taking big risks to cover these stories. Look at The New York Times, which the President demonizes often. The New York Times this weekend had an outstanding piece of reporting about how ISIS has been reaching out, is more involved in some attacks in Europe and abroad,"" he said. Ignatius said he has about 100 examples of strong reporting he'd like to show the President. CNN's Anderson Cooper also highlighted his coverage of many of the events listed. ""Not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list the White House has released, we covered them heavily. I know because I was there on the ground reporting a number of them,"" he said Monday night, before showing footage of himself reporting from Ottawa, Canada, in 2014; Paris in November 2015; San Bernardino, California, in 2015; in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He added: ""To be sure, we as a program did not cover each and every incident on the list, however other programs, as well as CNN International covered most if not all of them, many of them exhaustively."" The attacks listed span from September 2014 to December 2016, and include the Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin, the Brussels airport attack, the Istanbul airport and Sultanahmet attacks, and the Sydney siege. But the White House only mentions attacks that appear to have been carried out with Islamist motives and omits other terror operations. It does not mention the recent attack on a mosque in Quebec City, or the racially motivated attack by Dylann Roof on a church in South Carolina, in which nine black worshipers were shot dead. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters after Trump's statement that the President ""felt as though members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage."" Trump has used terror attacks to justify his controversial temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the US. He has also repeatedly referred to media organizations critical of him as ""fake news.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/trump-travel-ban-oral-arguments-what-you-need-to-know/index.html,Trump travel ban oral arguments: what you need to know,(CNN)Three federal judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals are set to hear oral arguments at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday in the challenge to President Donald Trump's travel ban.,"The lawsuit, brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump's executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals, and as a result, temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again. The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here's what to listen for: What's the hearing about? US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump's executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions. The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far. The players The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson. The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. When is this hearing? The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. It will be available for live streaming through the court's website. Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case. What are the states saying? On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place. The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had ""unleashed chaos"" by signing the order. They also argue that the government's claim -- that it would be ""irreparably harmed"" by keeping Robart's temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits -- doesn't make any sense. To accept DOJ's position, they argue, ""would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ...Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties."" What is the Trump administration's argument? The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening. DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second-guess the President's national security judgment in the immigration context. But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing -- suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court's decision, then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US -- like someone traveling on a student visa. In the government's view, aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US. What happens next? The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them) -- the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now. For example, the judges could dismiss DOJ's request for a stay of Robart's decision because, as the government acknowledges, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable, or they could uphold his ruling -- but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings. Alternatively, the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e.g., aliens living abroad) -- in which case the travel ban would go back into effect. After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court). Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court. At the moment, there are only eight justices on the court, meaning if there is a 4-4 split then the Ninth Circuit's ruling will be the law of the land.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/europe/romanian-president-on-corruption/index.html,"People appalled by corruption bill, Romanian President says","(CNN)The President of Romania has attacked the country's government in a speech in Parliament, saying ""Romanians are appalled"" over the corruption bill scandal that has rocked the country in recent days.","President Klaus Iohannis said it is time for Romania to decide whether it wants to be a ""strong prosperous"" nation or a ""weak despised one"" -- and he called for a referendum so the people can have their say. Half a million citizens took to the streets on Sunday in the largest of a series of demonstrations over a bill that would have protected many politicians from being prosecuted for corruption. The Social Democrat-led government announced that day in a statement that it was repealing the decree, which had been approved last week without input from Parliament. However, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu indicated that he still planned to push through the amendments to the criminal codes via legislation that would be put to Parliament for approval. Protests continued over the issue Monday night -- albeit on a smaller scale -- with calls for the government to be removed. 'Transparent government' In his speech on Tuesday, Iohannis, a former National Liberal Party politician, said withdrawing the decree is too little. Although he stopped short of calling for a fresh election, he told members of the center-left government, which has been in power since December, ""Your first worry was to take care of the files of the convicted (politicians). Romanians are appalled. ""The withdrawal of Ordnance 13 is too little. Early elections, at this point, is too much. Who needs to come up with a solution? The Social Democrats, as they created the problem."" At this point, members of the governing coalition -- made up of the Social Democrats and a smaller party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, walked out of the room. ""Are you already tired?"" asked the President. ""Too bad. Romania needs a strong government, a transparent one, whose governing is predictable, done in broad daylight, not stealthily at night."" He went on to ask, ""What kind of nation do we want to be? Do we want to be a strong, prosperous one, which builds a rule of law and respects it, where justice is strong and independent? Or do we want to be a weak nation, despised, which risks everything to save a few from difficult times?"" This, he said, would be the ""question and the purpose"" of a referendum, which would ""really find out the will of the Romanian people."" Demonstrations continue Around 25,000 demonstrators gathered in Victory Square, Bucharest, on Monday evening and around 20,000 elsewhere in the country, according to estimates by the Romanian media. Although they turned out in far smaller numbers than Sunday, they continued to call for the government to resign. A counter-demonstration with about 3,000 people gathered outside the presidential palace in support of the government, calling for Iohannis to resign. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Vlad Mixich, a Romanian journalist and political commentator, said of the President's address to Parliament, ""He talked mainly to the people who protested in the last week in the streets. I think it was important for him to do that. ""This was one of the biggest protests in Romania since (the fall of communism in) 1989. So he had to speak directly to those people who were in the streets to protest even if the protesters don't perceive the President as their leader""."" Mixich said the referendum suggested by the President ""would be a symbolic gesture. One of the type that politicians love so much -- it will keep this topic on the table."" A brighter future ""The protests won't stop until some of the ministers will quit their jobs. We've had enough of them,"" said Bianca Dumitru, 25, a sports journalist who joined protests in her home town of Brasov, central Romania. ""The last week was incredible for the whole country. We got so united and motivated that we have to thank the government for this. But I think it's time for them to let us enjoy the victory and live in a prosperous environment, with a bright future ahead."" Parliament is due on Wednesday to debate a censure motion submitted by the opposition in a bid to remove the government from office. This is not expected to succeed, as the coalition holds a majority in the legislative body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now that Obama is free from many Secret Service-imposed restrictions that did not allow him to partake in activities like surfing, Branson offered Obama the chance to learn how to kitesurf. But to make things more interesting, Branson took on a challenge of his own. ""We decided to set up a friendly challenge: Could Barack learn to kitesurf before I learned to foilboard? We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest,"" Branson wrote in a post on Virgin.com. Kitesurfing is riding on a surfboard while holding onto a kite and foilboarding is riding a surfboard with a hydrofoil that goes into the water lifts the board above the surface. Following a few days of training, the challenge was on and Obama kitesurfed his way to victory. ""We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 metres, three feet above the water,"" Branson wrote.

31,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/health/male-birth-control-vasalgel-contraceptive-monkey-trial-trnd/index.html,"Male contraceptive gel effective in monkeys, but will it work in humans?","(CNN)When it comes to contraception, there are no long-lasting, easily reversible options for men. The only choices are condoms or a vasectomy.","And it's been this way for more than a century. But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body, preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through, has proved effective in trials using monkeys. The researchers behind the product, known as Vasalgel, hope it could get trials in humans within a few years. ""What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans,"" said Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials. A new study, published Tuesday, involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females. Any adverse effects, as well as their ability to impregnate females, was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies. ""It was a simple efficacy study,"" Lissner said, meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy. The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season, and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time. One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly, and another developed a sperm granuloma, or lump of sperm, but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation, Lissner said, adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy. Lissner's team is hoping to conduct clinical trials in humans next year and plans to stage further animal trials this year in preparation. But although the gel worked well in monkeys, it won't necessarily translate perfectly to humans. ""This is a bigger, longer task than we first anticipated,"" Lissner said. Stopping sperm in their tracks Administering Vasalgel inside a man, or a monkey, involves a polymer injected into the sperm-carrying tubes between the testicles and penis, known as the vas deferens, to block sperm as they are released. The injection is given under anesthetic and mimics the effect of a vasectomy, but without the snip. ""It's a sticky gel that goes into (the tubes) and basically filters out sperm,"" Lissner said. A similar polymer called RISUG is being trialled in India and has proved effective in men. The new gel is injected in a location similar to that cut during a vasectomy and allows fluids through while blocking sperm. The backed-up sperm are then reabsorbed by the body. A further benefit is that -- unlike with a vasectomy -- the gel is meant to disintegrate when a second solution is injected to break down the barrier and flush it out. This would make the process reversible. Reversibility was shown in trials on rabbits, but it was not tested in the new trial on monkeys. Recent trials on baboons also failed to reverse the effect. ""Successful reversibility will be the key to make this world-changing,"" Lissner said. Invasive procedure A further factor likely to impact numbers using this method is that Vasalgel still involves minor surgery to pull out the sperm tubes and inject the gel. What's more, when sperm are reabsorbed into the body, there is a risk of an immune reaction, potentially leaving men less fertile after reversal -- similar to vasectomy, though risks with the gel are lower, according to Lissner. ""Fifty percent of men after a vasectomy reversal remain infertile,"" said Dr. Ilpo Huhtaniemi, emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the new study. However, he points out that this doesn't prevent men from having children, as sperm can still be collected and used for in-vitro fertilization. The latest evidence on monkeys has many hoping a new form of contraceptive may be on the horizon, but experts believe more evidence is first needed on its reversibility. ""In order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible, and it's reassuring that apparently such studies are ongoing,"" said Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who was also not involved in the new research. ""The idea of trying to replace the traditional method of vasectomy by inserting a gel into the tube which carries sperm from the testicles to the penis at ejaculation is not a new one. However, we haven't seen much progress in developing the idea in recent years, so this study is a useful step in the right direction."" A male hormonal birth control injection was shown to prevent pregnancy in a 2016 study but was ended early due to side effects. Other approaches have involved strategies to control the production of sperm by targeting the hormone testosterone, but this had side effects of depression and weight gain. In 2015, Japanese scientists discovered a protein, calcineurin, found to be crucial in helping sperm swim and break through the membrane of a female egg in order to fertilize it. When the genes behind this protein were blocked during studies in mice, they became infertile. But Vasalgel is further along than the Japanese research and has not shown severe side effects in animals. Lissner is confident that her team's gel will overcome the challenges. She sees value in providing birth control that does not interfere with hormones. ""Why manipulate the whole body when there's a small tube that all the sperm swim through?"" she asked. Huhtaniemi agrees that Vasalgel could be valuable in certain populations but feels that in terms of birth control for the masses, a less-invasive option is needed. ""We need a pill. That's the easiest to administer,"" he said. ""It is feasible. We just need to find the right target.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/europe/vladimir-kara-murza-suffers-organ-failure/index.html,Putin critic in 'grave' condition after suffering full organ failure,"Moscow (CNN)A vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said he was poisoned in 2015, has suffered ""full organ failure"" and is still in ""grave"" condition after being hospitalized in Moscow last week, his wife says.","Doctors in the hospital where Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, is being treated say they still ""have no real idea"" what caused his illness, but agree a ""toxic substance"" is to blame, his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told CNN. Kara-Murza's wife, Yevgenia, told CNN that doctors have tried to bring her husband out of a medically-induced coma but that when they did so, he ""had almost no reaction at all, except to his name being called."" He is currently on dialysis and artificial ventilation. She said doctors have diagnosed him with ""acute intoxication by an unidentified substance"" and that there is ""no prognosis,"" adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness. Prokhorov told CNN that an investigator from the Khamovniki district of Moscow contacted him last Friday to inquire about the circumstances which led to Kara-Murza's hospitalization, but has not received any further updates about the ongoing investigation. ""The problem is that they are not paying any real attention to this,"" Prokhorov said. ""The investigative committee is only interested in this situation because of the media coverage."" He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in Kara-Murza's 2015 illness. Moscow denies involvement in 2015 health scare CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after a mysterious illness nearly killed him. ""I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver,"" he said at the time. He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. ""Frankly there is no other possible reason,"" he said. ""I don't have any money dealings. I don't have any personal enemies. I didn't steal anybody's wife."" The case had parallels with the killing of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London. A British public inquiry into that 2006 poisoning found two former Russian agents responsible for carrying out the poisoning with the radioactive isotope Polonium-210. Its final report concluded that Putin was ""probably"" aware of the operation. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated and the Kremlin said Russia wasn't involved. In February 2015, a leading Russian opposition figure and friend of Kara-Murza, Boris Nemtsov, was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. US lawmakers urge investigation Kara-Murza's hospitalization has triggered an outcry from US lawmakers, who have called on the Trump administration to speak out on his behalf. US Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Putin should be held accountable if there is evidence the government poisoned Kara-Murza. ""Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,"" said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. ""I am praying that Kara-Murza's condition improves."" He urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. Kara-Murza, who splits his time between Russia and his family home in Virginia, is a dual Russian-British citizen. He is part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. When he fell ill last week, Kara-Murza was touring Russia for screenings of a documentary about Nemtsov.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/health/arkansas-rape-law-trnd/index.html,New law lets husbands sue wives to stop abortion - even in rape cases,(CNN)A new Arkansas law will let a husband sue a doctor to stop his wife from getting an abortion. And it makes no exception for cases of spousal rape.,"The law, called the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, was passed and signed by Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and goes into effect later this year. It prohibits dismemberment abortion, the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. A clause in the law states that the husband of a woman getting the abortion can sue the doctor to stop his wife's abortion. The husband has to be the father of the child. And because there's no exemption in the law for rape or incest, a woman's rapist could theoretically file suit to stop the abortion. The ACLU of Arkansas claims the law is unconstitutional and plans to challenge it in court before it goes into effect. One Arkansas lawmaker said there wasn't much debate about those parts of the law. ""It was not something that was talked about on the Senate floor,"" Arkansas state Sen. Joyce Elliott told CNN affiliate KARK. ""If we cannot make headway on something like an exception for rape and incest, I think it just felt kind of fruitless to make some sense out of the rest of what was in the bill."" Elliott added, ""They don't see the outrage in constantly putting the thumb on women to dictate what they can do and not do."" But another lawmaker believes husbands should have a voice in these decisions. ""I think a woman does have control over her own body, but when you have created a life, you created a life with someone else,"" said state Sen. Missy Irvin. Kansas and Oklahoma passed similar abortion laws which are tied up in the courts, according to CNN affiliate KFSM. A few states, with conservative lawmakers emboldened by Donald Trump's election, have passed strict new abortion laws, including Ohio, which passed a measure banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

36,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/asia/china-japan-disputed-islands-intrusion/index.html,Chinese ships sail near disputed Japanese islands,"(CNN)Three Chinese Coast Guard ships entered waters near a chain of islands claimed by both China and Japan in the East China Sea on Monday, according to authorities from both sides.","Japan controls the chain and calls them the Senkaku Islands, while China calls them the Diaoyu Islands. The sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed America's commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy. Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the disputed islands,-including face-offs between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces-that have been termed dangerous by both sides. EXPLAINER: How an uninhabited island chain split Japan and China China's State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country's Coast Guard, put out a statement late Monday saying the three ships ""cruised within China's Diaoyu Islands territorial sea."" China's Defense Ministry, which is separate from the Oceanic Administration, posted a statement on its website confirming the Coast Guard ship movement. Japan's Coast Guard said the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters. It was the fourth time Chinese ships have entered Japan's waters this year, the Japanese Coast Guard said. There were 36 such incidents in 2016, it said. Despite the frequency of the Chinese sailings, experts said having one so soon after Mattis' visit to Japan sent a subtle message to both Tokyo and Washington. ""It is both a signal that China won't be intimidated from defending its interests/claims and a test to see how the new (Trump) administration responds,"" said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center. Denny Roy, an Asian security expert at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said ship movements in disputed waters could result in a shooting incident. ""The danger is especially high considering military personnel on both sides are often eager to demonstrate their determination to defend what they consider national territory,"" Roy said. And a China-Japan military confrontation could bring US forces into play. During a press conference Saturday in Tokyo, Mattis said the US would defend the islands with Japan. ""I made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands -- the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,"" Mattis said in an appearance with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. The US position was reinforced Tuesday in a phone call between Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from Japan's Foreign Ministry. ""The United States will be against any unilateral action made to damage the Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands,"" Tillerson stated during the call, according to the Japanese statement. China responded quickly on Saturday to the US stance on the islands, saying it brings instability to the region. ""Diaoyu and its affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be changed. The so-called US-Japan security treaty was a product of the Cold War, and it should not harm China's territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. ""We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and stop making wrong remarks on the issue of the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands,"" Lu said. The US commitment to the Senkakus is not new. In 2014, the Obama administration also said the remote chain fell under the treaty. In late 2013, China-declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the East China Sea, including the Senkakus, despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. Japan also has an ADIZ over the islands. Although the Senkakus are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral and fishing rights in the surrounding waters. While the Senkakus remain a source of friction in the US-China relationship, Mattis' visit seemed to have soothed relations a bit in another area, the South China Sea. Although the US defense chief said ""China has shredded the trust of nations in the region"" by fortifying disputed South China Sea islands, Mattis also said no increased US military maneuvers there were needed. Lu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, on Monday welcomed that stance. ""As for Mattis' comment that there is no need for large-scale military operations in the area and the issue should be resolved through diplomacy, these remarks deserve our affirmation,"" Lu said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The attack at around 3:45 p.m. local time targeted Supreme Court employees as they were leaving for the day, Mojahid said. At least 35 people were wounded in the blast, according to Saleem Rasooli, head of Kabul hospitals. There have been no initial claims of responsibility. An eyewitness told CNN that he felt the explosion shake the ground as he was leaving his office, opposite the Supreme Court. Nimatullah Mati said the area is home to several residential apartments and was crowded Tuesday afternoon with people who were heading home from work. Ambulances and firetrucks arrived on the scene within five minutes, Mati said. Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, expressed his condolences on Twitter. ""The blood of our people isn't cheap & won't be wasted,"" he said. NATO also condemned the attack. ""Anyone who seeks to destabilize the pillars of a functioning government are enemies of Afghanistan,"" Italian army Lt. Gen. Rosario Castellano, deputy commander of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement. The blast comes a month after at least 36 people were killed and dozens wounded in two suicide bombings near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for those January 10 attacks. Tuesday's blast underscores the growing concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, where the country's security forces and its international allies have been fighting Taliban militants and other radical groups for years. A new report Monday from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said more than 11,000 people were killed or injured in 2016. That's the highest number of civilian casualties in a single year since the United Nations began systemically documenting those in 2009. The report also shows a record spike in the number of children killed in the long-running Afghanistan War. Of the 3,498 killed last year, 923 were children, the report said. Anti-government forces, mainly the Taliban, were behind almost two-thirds of the casualties, according to the report. ISIS militants have established a presence in the country, and their attacks particularly target Shia Muslims, the report said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amnesty's report, Human slaughterhouse, says prisoners are moved in the middle of the night from their cells under the pretext of being transferred. They are taken to the grounds of the prison, where they are hanged, likely unaware of their fate until they feel the noose around their neck, Amnesty alleges. The report is the culmination of a year-long investigation, including interviews with 84 witnesses including security guards, detainees, judges and lawyers, Amnesty says. Most of those hanged were civilians ""believed to be opposed to the government,"" the report finds. ""The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,"" Lynn Maalouf, the deputy director for research at Amnesty's Beirut office, said in a statement announcing the report. Amnesty International says there are two detention centers at Saydnaya prison. In the ""red building,"" the majority of detainees are civilians who have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, according to the organization. In the ""white building,"" the detainees are mainly military officers and soldiers. CNN has asked the Syrian government for comment. The report contends that the executed detainees were given a sham trial by ""a so-called Military Field Court."" ""The judge will ask the name of the detainee and whether he committed the crime. Whether the answer is yes or no, he will be convicted ... This court has no relation with the rule of law. This is not a court,"" a former judge said, according to Amnesty. Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty International researcher, elaborated on the horrific conditions prisoners allegedly face. ""They have been actually dying in massive numbers as a result of repeated torture in combination with the systematic deprivation of food, water, medicine and medical care,"" she told CNN. ""(The report) has gotten the attention it deserved,"" Waldman said. ""It's a big story. But for people who work on Syria, it was almost a test case for 'Does the world still care, not just about death but the fact that it was organized, systematic?'"" In light of its findings, she said Amnesty is calling for investigation without delay and for the UN to act immediately. ""I want to be very clear that these practices are unacceptable, and they have to stop. They have to be brought to an end. Mass killings of civilians and extermination so that people are dying of starvation, of illness, of treatable diseases must stop, and Russia has a very special responsibility to uphold peace and security in the world,"" Waldman said. ""We are calling on them to use their influence with the Syrian authorities to push for access to independent monitors to all of the prisons in Syria run by the government where these atrocities are taking place so the perpetrators can be held to account."" Speaking at the UN, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Peter Wilson responded to the report's allegations. ""We have seen the report of Amnesty International on atrocities in Syria,"" he said. ""Our foreign secretary has said he is sickened by that report. We strongly condemn these atrocities, and we continue to effort to shine a light on what's happening in Syria and to hold people accountable for these actions."" 'Just a headline' President Assad's regime has previously been accused of extrajudicial killings and war crimes during the country's civil war, which broke out in 2011. In 2014, CNN was given a copy of a report that found ""direct evidence"" of ""systematic torture and killing"" by the Syrian government, based on photographs leaked by a Syrian defector. One of the report's authors called it a ""smoking gun"" proving the use of torture. But Assad has steadfastly maintained that many of the accusations leveled against him are politically motivated. ""I'm just a headline -- the bad president, the bad guy, who is killing the good guys,"" Assad told a group of western visitors, including The New York Times, in November. ""You know this narrative. The real reason is toppling the government. This government doesn't fit the criteria of the United States."" The UN estimates that about 400,000 people have been killed since the start of the war and another 4.8 million have fled the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The start hut is cut into a rock face and the slick slope is so steep -- 100% or 45 degrees -- TV cameramen must abseil into positions wearing crampons. But the one skier able to conquer their fear and harness this breakneck speed will be crowned world downhill champion for the next two years. The race is the highlight of the 2017 World Championships, which start this week in the chic Swiss town. St. Moritz, the jewel of the Engadin valley, has been a longtime destination for the jetset and draws a well-heeled international clientele to its fine-dining restaurants and five-star hotels.  Often dubbed the ""home of winter sports,"" St. Moritz has hosted two Winter Olympics and four previous World Championships. A total of 600 athletes from more than 70 countries will compete across six alpine skiing disciplines -- slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill, super combined (downhill and slalom) and the team event. Outside of the Olympics, it's the biggest event in the sport and carries more cachet than the World Cup circuit. ""It's winning, basically, the Olympics minus all the other sports -- that's what the World Championships is for us. It's big,"" Mikaela Shiffrin, who leads the World Cup overall and slalom standings, told CNN's Alpine Edge. The 21-year-old American is going for a third straight slalom world title after winning gold in Schladming in 2013 and Beaver Creek two years ago. She also won the Olympic slalom gold in 2014, and is aware she has set herself a very high benchmark. ""Not winning stinks -- it makes me feel like I've done something wrong,"" Shiffrin adds. But the headline attraction will be her compatriot Lindsey Vonn, the second most successful ski racer of all time -- male or female -- with 77 World Cup wins, behind only Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark (86). Speed queen Vonn, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion, won her only world title in 2009 and is back on the circuit following a broken arm and severe nerve damage to her right hand sustained in a crash shortly after returning from knee surgery. Vonn won in only her second race since returning to the circuit in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany in January, but crashed in a downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy this month. In St. Moritz Tuesday, she skied out during the opening run of the World Championships' first race -- the women's super-G -- after trying to regain grip on her pole. ""I just kind of lost my concentration there for a minute,"" Vonn, the 2015 bronze medalist, told reporters. ""I stayed on my feet, so that was the important thing."" Austria's Nicole Schmidhofer won the gold medal from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein and home favorite Lara Gut in perfect conditions, after two days of heavy snow had canceled the men's and women's downhill training sessions. Defending champion and Olympic gold medalist Anna Veith didn't make the second run after missing a gate. The women's downhill start is lower than the men's but still a considerable test of skill and stamina. Vonn's main rivals on Sunday will be World Cup overall champion Gut and Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec, this season's World Cup downhill leader. Another Slovenian Tina Maze, who has since retired, won the world title in 2015. The men's downhill takes place Saturday on the legendary ""Free Fall"" course, which was dreamed up by Bernhard Russi, the Swiss two-time downhill world champion and 1972 Olympic gold medalist. READ: Vonn crashes in Cortina READ: Vonn wins first race since comeback READ: Lindsey Vonn -- 'Hardest recovery of my career' Racers access the start hut via a steel staircase before plunging from 9,317 feet to 6,692 feet down to the Salastrains plateau above St. Moritz. Switzerland's Patrick Kung is the defending champion, but Italy's Peter Fill won the 2015-16 World Cup title and leads the standings this season. Norway's Kjetil Jansrud and Italian Dominik Paris, the winner in Kitzbuhel, are second and third in the World Cup standings. Former wold junior champion Beat Feuz triumphed at St. Moritz last year and the 29-year-old Swiss skier could improve on his World Championship bronze from Beaver Creek in 2015. The men's slalom on February 19 is likely to be a shootout between Austria's Marcel Hirscher and Sweden's Henrik Kristofferson. Hirscher, 27, has won four World Championship golds and a record five overall World Cup titles, while 22-year-old Kristofferson is last year's World Cup slalom champion. It is worth keeping an eye on Briton Dave Ryding, who has been making waves after scoring his country's joint best result in a World Cup race with a second place in the slalom in Kitzbuhel last month. He equaled the achievement of Konrad Bartelski in a downhill in Val Gardena, Italy in 1981. Ryding followed it up with 10th in the Schladming night slalom and sits fifth in the World Cup slalom standings.

42,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/arts/bio-art-microbes-and-machines/index.html,Of microbes and machines: How art and science fuse in bio-art,"Sean Redmond is one of the curators of the Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts exhibition. Darrin Sean Verhagen works for RMIT University. He has previously received funding from the Australia Council, Arts Victoria and City of Melbourne.","There is art in science -- the artistic precision of the scalpel, the cool aesthetics of the laboratory, and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world. Bio-art, an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s, solidifies, extends and enriches this organic relationship. According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey, it represents: ""a crossover of art and the biological sciences, with living matter, such as genes, cells or animals, as its new media."" Bio-artists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space; bringing living and dead matter into the gallery. They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities. In BioCouture, for example, fashion, art, and biology are weaved together, blossoming new materials into existence. As author Suzanne Anker has noted, ""Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have invented dresses made from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine. Suzanne Lee composes 'growing' textiles produced by sugar, tea and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos."" Lee makes jackets out of cellulose produced by bacteria in baths of green tea and sugar. Bio-art includes the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video, the membranes of sound, and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs. To take another example, in Christian B?k's The Xenotext, a ""chemical alphabet"" is used to translate poetry into sequences of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium. When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell, the poetry constitutes a set of instructions, all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response. Writes B?k: ""I am, in effect, engineering a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem ""-one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes..."" Scientists and artists work together in what become teeming new spaces of co-creation. Together, they often set Bio-art within current debates and concerns about what constitutes life, what counts as a sentient being, and who gets to determine what lives are saved, exploited or destroyed. Bio-art draws together the hopes and concerns of scientists and artists as we hurtle into an age where human life and everyday living seems to be undergoing radical and sometimes dangerous transformations. As author Sheel Patel suggests in relation to Bok's work: ""If a living cell can be cultured to spit out and produce novel poetry, could we eventually live in a society where humans are no longer needed to produce new thoughts, and works of literature?"" Arts and disease In the interactive art-science exhibition Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts, actual and metaphoric communicative diseases are employed to explore the often toxic relationship between human and non-human life. The exhibition explores the thin doorway that exists between life and death in a vexing age of species and habitat destruction, and the increasingly permeable tissues of contemporary bodies. The discourses of science in particular train us to see and to look for disease in every location. Science's microscopic and bio-technological powers allow it to reach into every atom. Of course, dominant discourse also communes that some spaces, things, and objects are more diseased than others. We are taught to see disease in the homes of outsiders and the nests of insects, in the fabric of pariah nation states and the tissues of certain religions and philosophies. At the same time, new materialism and animal philosophy question the very parameters of what life is, where it can be found, and they turn the question of disease onto humankind, whose activities are seen to infect all that it touches and taints. There is a frightening collision, then, between the possibilities and limitations of human and non-human life: caught as it were between nightmare and dream. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is composed of 11 artistic works, with each piece using a different media or art form to explore the chaos of the world it draws upon. Each artist imagines disease differently, and yet within the terror of their imaginings there is great beauty, and much hope. In Drew Berry's video projection, infectious cells are ""set free"" so that the very connective tissue of the exhibition room teems with the droplets of life and death. Herpes, influenza, HIV, polio and smallpox bacteria are projected onto the gallery wall as if they have taken flight. Magnified and chaotic, those entering the space are hit by their scale and size. Lienors Torre's multimedia and glass work on degenerative vision explores how our view of the world is metered and tainted by digital technologies. We see two large glass eyeballs, a liquid animation, and a glass cabinet full of jars filled with water in varying degrees of opacity, with engraved eye images on them. Eyes quickly become raindrops as the liquidity of vision is brought to watery life. There are tears and scars that reflect across the eyes of this exquisite art-piece. In Alison Bennett's touch-based screen work, the viewer is presented with a high-resolution scan of bruised skin. Viewers can use the touch-screen to manipulate the soft and damaged tissue before them, and their eyes become organs of touch. What does it feel like to touch a bruise and be bruised? The gallery is thus, both laboratory and studio. In all its variant forms, and with a scalpel and a paintbrush to hand, Bio-art fashions the world anew. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is currently exhibited at the RMIT Gallery until February 18, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/sport/joost-van-der-westhuizen-south-africa-rugby-alistair-hargreaves-cobus-visagie/index.html,Joost van der Westhuizen: Fearless rugby legend 'broke the mold',"(CNN)Joost van der Westhuizen finally lost his brave battle with a body-wasting disease, but his powerful legacy lives on in modern rugby.","Wheelchair-bound and barely able to talk in his later years, the South Africa legend passed away Monday aged 45. Motor neurone disease had left him a shadow of the gladiator who helped the Springboks win the World Cup in 1995, but his contribution to the game will never be forgotten, says former teammate Cobus Visagie. ""Joost basically created the new requirements for a modern No. 9,"" the former South Africa front-row prop told CNN's World Sport show Tuesday. Van der Westhuizen was 6 foot 2 inches tall, but played at scrumhalf -- a position traditionally occupied by the game's smallest players, providing the link between teams' backs and forwards. ""Some days I looked down when we were standing in a circle and saw a man with boots three sizes bigger than myself -- a scrumhalf!"" added Visagie, who played alongside van der Westhuizen at the 1999 World Cup and won 29 caps for his country. ""He had incredible speed, he had incredible bravery -- he's very well known for the tackles he made in the crucial 1995 World Cup, but also in all other games."" In the 1995 World Cup final against New Zealand, van der Westhuizen stopped a rampaging Jonah Lomu when the giant winger had broken through the South African defense. The Springboks went on to win 15-12 in extra time, in the first major sporting event to be staged in South Africa after the end of Apartheid rule. The '95 side has achieved iconic status, notably through the Hollywood film ""Invictus."" ""Who could forget that '95 World Cup tackle?"" former Springboks forward Alistair Hargreaves told CNN. ""He was fearless, and for a scrumhalf he certainly broke the mold. As a young boy, he epitomized what South African rugby was all about. We idolized him."" READ: Blitzboks star leaves sevens on a high READ: Scotland stuns Ireland in Six Nations opener READ: Van der Westhuizen vows to fight motor neurone disease Courage on the field -- and off it Van der Westhuizen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011, having retired from international rugby in 2003 with what was then a record 89 caps for the Springboks. Also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, the condition causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time. In 2014 the ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" became a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people helping to raise awareness and funds to research the disease. Although he never played alongside van der Westhuizen, Hargreaves -- who left South Africa in 2012 to play domestic rugby in England -- was fortunate enough to met his childhood hero later in life. ""I met him after his career and I probably met him at a time that his illness really kicked in,"" Hargreaves said. ""If he was resilient on the field, he certainly proved to be resilient and even more courageous when he found out about the terrible circumstances he found himself in. ""What a brilliant battle he fought. You can only respect the man for what he did."" After his diagnosis, van der Westhuizen set up the J9 Foundation, a charity dedicated to helping sufferers of motor neurone disease. ""It is incredibly sad, but Joost fought a long battle,"" Hargreaves added. ""He was aware of the struggle he faced and I presume there is a certain amount of relief at the end of it. ""The guy has achieved so much, he's done so much for rugby, I'm sure they're going to hold him up as a real legend of the game.""

Nothing is okay anymore","(CNN)In the 26th century BC, the Egyptians constructed the Great Pyramid of Giza, an architectural marvel that would remain the tallest structure in the world for millennia, and still stands to this day.","In 1499 AD, Michelangelo completed the Pieta, a transcendent marriage of classical ideals and divine imagination long considered one of the finest works ever freed from stone. In 2017, a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that looks like a dead gorilla was put up for sale on the internet. Well, we had a good run. We're going to choose NOT to believe the Cheeto -- which ""looks like Harambe the Gorilla"" in the way any given Cheeto looks like anything -- sold for almost $100,000 after a 132-episode bidding war. That's what the eBay page says, but if you believe that, then you are admitting the flame of human innovation dies here, snuffed out under an amorphous log of cornmeal and monosodium glutamate. The seller of this foul totem does, however, appear to be legit. The account has been active since 2008 and has enough buyer and seller feedback for there to be a dim possibility that someone doled out a luxury cars' worth of cash on a Cheeto. CNN has reached out for comment. Really, we did. To salt the wound, there are now dozens of Harambe Cheeto-related items polluting the eBay listings, a cruel burlesque at the nadir of consumerism and irony and possibly humanity itself. If you want one, you can buy one with your hard-earned money. Or, you could open up any bag of Cheetos and squint. It doesn't matter.

45,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/africa/maasai-tanzania-wildlife-warriors/index.html,Lion-killer Maasai turn wildlife warriors to save old enemy,"(CNN)The Maasai have roamed Tanzania since time immemorial. Cattle in tow, the East African pastoralists have circled the land looking for fresh grass, co-existing with nature for as long as anyone can remember.","But nature is not always kind. Fifty percent of the world's lion population lives in East Africa -- and lions like to eat livestock. Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds, often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions. There were ritual killings also, known as ""Ala-mayo."" Killing a lion, a symbol of strength and power, was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into ""Morani,"" the warrior class. Armed with a spear, these youths became men in the process, returning to the tribe to be treated with new-found respect. The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s, but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned. In Ngorongoro Crater, north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959, the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence. In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year, but as with so much of the world in the 20th century, the Maasai's population grew in Ngorongoro. Forty lions, if not more, are now under threat annually in the conservation area, and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining. Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed, and in a remarkable turnaround they've enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe: the Maasai themselves. At around 5am the Maasai ""Wildlife Warriors"" rise to birdsong, nature's alarm clock. A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day. Slipping on a pair of sandals, their soles recycled from old car tires, the Warriors head out of their ""kraal,"" a small sheltered community, to begin tracking. These Maasai have traded in their hunting ways for a life of conservation. Part of an initiative run by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund, an organization specializing in human-animal conflict, the Warriors are spread across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland, using their skills, their lifeblood, to protect what was once their adversary. Beyond the ""boma,"" a low wall surrounding the ""kraal,"" tracks line the dirt. They betray the lions, hyenas and wild dogs who visit in the night, drawn to livestock and, in the dry season, the community's water supply. On an uneventful day, Warriors might take a car owned by the Fund and conduct an animal headcount, circling the Steppe in the early morning. But sometimes tracks start inside the ""boma,"" suggesting a big cat. When big cat footprints are involved, they usually lead to a kill. The next step is crucial. ""People are becoming more and more angry towards wildlife,"" says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje. In the past a carcass resulted in retribution. The head of cattle per person has decreased among the Maasai in recent years, meaning the pain of every loss is felt all the more. ""The community finds it very difficult to comprehend the importance of the wildlife,"" Lengoje adds. ""It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe you, as they care more about their livestock than wildlife."" Some of the reprisals have become extreme. Aside from spearings, Maasai have begun poisoning carcasses between a lion's initial gorge and second feed. This not only kills the lion, but anything that feeds on the lion's subsequent carcass. Wildlife Warriors intercede, dissipate the situation, and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them. One of their primary concerns is to document the attack and location, using GPS to map the incident on the Fund's database. They'll also warn neighboring herders of the dangers nearby, and sometimes provide contact details so Maasai can claim compensation from the government. Then begins the long-term approach to preventing cattle loss. ""Living Walls"" (African myrrh trees joined by chain link fences) are being used by the Fund and built in collaboration with the Maasai, and have been rolled out across communities. ""The difference between the 'boma' and the Living Wall is that the living wall uses chain link,"" explains Elvis Kisimir, from the Fund. 'Bomas' contain dried twigs from the thorny acacia bush, but chain link is infinitely more effective, especially when fortified with living, fast-growing thorny trees, which only become more impassable with age. In the wet season these walls reach over 12 feet high. ""We currently have more than 700 'bomas,' and the Living Wall is a program that has safeguarded 99% of our livestock at night,"" says Kisimir. This immediate success is being supplemented with education programs fronted by Maasai Wildlife Warriors, aimed at neutralizing any antagonism between man and his fellow predators. ""If we decided to do this on our own, we wouldn't achieve much,"" admits Kisimir. ""Community is everything."" Laly Lichtenfeld, executive director of the Fund, describes this as ""the next step,"" and a way to help create a self-regulating environment in which both Maasai and lions can prosper. ""The Maasai people are absolutely critically integral to the conservation process in northern Tanzania,"" she adds. ""This is their land, and their livelihoods are so dependent on wise environmental stewardship. ""Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock. And the livestock, the cattle, are core of their being -- who they are. It's their pride, it's their identity; it's their economic wellbeing. And so if they can manage to really keep these ecosystems intact and healthy, then everything in the system benefits.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/health/dalai-lama-humor-how-you-can-have-it-too/index.html,"Playful humor: The Dalai Lama's secret weapon (and how it can be yours, too)","(CNN)When you are the spiritual leader of an entire people, you've lived your entire adult life in exile, your movements are restricted by ever-watchful bodyguards and you must watch every word for fear of setting off an international incident, you would think your face would reflect the weight of the world.","But when you are the Dalai Lama, the deepest lines on your 81-year-old skin are laugh lines. His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone, largely because of his sense of humor. It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life. When he presided over the Emory-Tibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod, India, he showed his teasing nature right away. Gathered were thousands of saffron-robed nuns and monks, world-renowned scientists, Tibetans and many interested followers, eager learn how to ""bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment."" The crowd looked as serious as the topic. As they waited in the temple, they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats. Finally, the low moan of a guttural chant began, and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter. When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door, the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded. Some prostrated themselves on the ground. His Holiness walked in slowly, surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress. Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps. At the bottom, the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy, laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor. ""When you smile, I notice everyone around you smiles. I notice it is very contagious as well,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical correspondent, in an interview with His Holiness after the event. ""Basically, we are social animal,"" the Dalai Lama replied. ""We need friend. In order to develop genuine friendship, trust is very important. For trust, if you show them genuine sort of respect, genuine love, then trust come, so here I think the expression of genuine warm feeling smile I think part of that, that's genuine smile."" But it is clear that joking around is also key to winning over a crowd. At the event, the Dalai Lama finally sat in his floral chair, against what looked like a pillow one of the monks must have grabbed from his bed, hoping to make him more comfortable. The crowd quieted, leaning forward to hear what His Holiness had to say. But instead of a prayer or a gentle word of wisdom, he decided it was the perfect time to wipe his brow. He took his time and then, rather than putting the white washcloth on the table next to him, he immediately put it on his head, where it rested like an absurd floppy hat. Giggling, he wore it through first part of the meeting, for about an hour. Then, he reached with some ceremony for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him. ""This is not decoration,"" he joked, holding it up. He pointed to himself -- ""eat"" -- and promptly unwrapped the gold foil to pop a hard candy into his mouth. His impish behavior, laughing and joking did the trick. The solemn and respectful crowd began laughing with him, warming up immediately. Everyone seemed ready to listen to a discussion of heavy topics such as ""What are the fundamental constituents of the universe, and how did it originate?"" and ""How is knowledge established and what constitutes valid reasoning?"" When Gupta later asked His Holiness about why he decided to wear the washcloth so comically, the Dalai Lama admitted it was, in part, because he is practical and gets hot. But he also hinted that there was something deeper: It's important for leaders, particularly spiritual leaders, to ""act like a human being"" and to be playful. Often, ""everyone too much formal,"" he said, ""That is self-torture."" And though he knows he must respect those leaders, despite ""no word, no movement"" from them, he has sometimes developed ""a strange thinking"" and often hopes something unexpected will happen to make that leader act more ""like a human being."" ""I had this experience (in) 1954 when I was in Peking,"" His Holiness said. ""Some Indian ambassador, he call on me, come to my room, then as usual, some Chinese foreign ministries officials come. ""Everyone too much formal like that,"" he said then mimed being stiff. ""Then somehow they brought some fruit, somehow dumped over, and then everyone acted like a human being,"" he said, laughing and miming people scrambling around, as he saw them do around on the floor. His Holiness suggests everyone let themselves be playful and find the funny in life. In his book ""My Spiritual Journey,"" he calls himself a ""professional laugher"" and writes that he comes from a cheerful family that is always ""amusing ourselves, teasing each other, joking. It's our habit."" A quick laugh and an ability to see humor in daily situations and to be playful have been shown to help adults lower stress levels, both for themselves and for those around them, studies show. By being playful and using humor, people also become more observant and more empathetic. They are often bored less, they learn more, they have more friends, and studies show that people who are willing to let out their playful side tend to have a better sense of all-around well-being.  His Holiness believes that no matter how difficult your life may be, this approach will bring you something much deeper. ""Thinking only of the negative aspect doesn't help to find solutions and it destroys peace of mind,"" he writes. ""I love smiles, and my wish is to see more smiles, real smiles. ... If we want those smiles, we must create the reasons that make them appear.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

48,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/opinions/trump-claim-on-under-covering-terrorism-is-baloney-bergen/index.html,Trump's terrorism claim is baloney,"Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists.""","Now comes President Donald Trump's claim Monday at the key US military base overseeing the war on ISIS -- US Central Command in Tampa, Florida -- that the media aren't reporting terrorism for ""reasons"" the President didn't elaborate upon. Trump told the CENTCOM audience, ""You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that."" To ""prove"" that the media aren't covering terrorism adequately the Trump White House, which is fighting in court to reinstate a refugee ban citing the terrorist threat, on Monday night released a list of 78 ""major"" terrorist attacks since September 2014, claiming, ""Most have not received the media attention they deserved."" This is one of the biggest baloney sandwiches this White House has foisted on the public since ... well ... the ""Bowling Green massacre,"" but it's a much bigger and harder-to swallow helping of baloney because it is the President who is forcing it down our throats rather than one of his aides. Taking the White House timeline of terrorist attacks, I ran it through the Nexis database, which is an authoritative resource for tracking media hits of all types, including in newspapers, magazines, wire service reports, TV news shows and the like. The results show that terrorist attacks over the past couple of years are, in fact, some of the most well-reported stories of our times. The total number of media hits for the 78 terrorist attacks that the White House released Monday is 80,878, or about an average of slightly more than 1,000 mentions per incident. And those numbers clearly understate how much coverage the media have given these incidents because a Nexis search only will display a maximum of 3,000 mentions for any given search. There are 16 terrorist attacks on the White House list of purportedly under-covered attacks that each elicited more than 3,000 media mentions. The following are a representative sample: ""?In Ottawa in October 2014 Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a Canadian soldier. ""?Two months later in Sydney, Man Haron Monis killed two Australians. ""?In March 2015, 21 tourists were killed at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. ""?Two months later in Garland, Texas, two ISIS-inspired militants attacked a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest. Luckily no one was killed except the terrorists. ""?In Tunisia, also in 2015, 38 were killed at a beach popular with Westerners. ""?In October 2015, 224 were killed in Sinai, Egypt, when ISIS brought down a Russian passenger jet with a bomb. The terror attacks in Paris and Nice, France, that Trump cited in his CENTCOM speech also received more than 3,000 media mentions. The terrorist attacks that didn't get as much coverage were -- surprise --- the ones where there were no deaths or that took place in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh where there is little independent media reporting. In three cases, there were no articles listed in the publications included in the Nexis database, and in each of those cases there were no casualties. The media, including CNN, have exhaustively covered terrorism around the globe since the 9/11 attacks made the issue a central national security concern. Indeed, the wall-to-wall media coverage of the ISIS attacks in Paris in November 2015 in which 129 were killed and the ISIS-inspired attack in San Bernardino, California, a month later in which 14 were killed was instrumental in boosting Trump in the polls, according to the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight Many Americans felt threatened by the ISIS-directed and ISIS-inspired attacks. As the presidential campaign was in full swing at the beginning of 2016, just over half of Americans said they were very or somewhat worried that they, or a member of their family, would be victims of a terrorist attack. This was the largest number to feel that way since just after the 9/11 attacks. And how did so many Americans learn about the terrorist attacks they were so scared of? Here's a clue: It wasn't through telepathy. Below is the official White House timeline of terrorist attacks since September 2014 with my annotations in bold about the media coverage they each received. (There are a number of incorrectly spelled words I have left as they were in the original.)

49,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/opinions/fight-for-democracy-opinion-ghitis/index.html,Trump vs. America: The fight for democracy,"Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.","Trump was defending the Russian President after Fox's Bill O'Reilly called Putin a ""killer."" His response, ""You think our country is so innocent,"" reveals Trump's dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody. Clearly, the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history, but the country's guiding principles have remained unchanged: the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals. In Russia, by contrast, Putin has decimated the opposition, imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government. The free press is a faint shadow of its former self, and Putin's critics, including journalists, continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances. One of Putin's most vocal critics, Vladimir Kara-Murza, remains in a Moscow hospital in ""grave condition"" after suffering a ""full organ failure"" that, as his lawyer told CNN, doctors agree is the result of a ""toxic substance."" Despite Trump's comments and recent executive actions, Trump should expect push-back from a country committed to liberal democratic principles. This division between the President and the American people makes the United States the latest battleground in a worldwide clash of ideologies. When the wave of populist authoritarianism started, few would have expected the United States, the principal beacon of modern democracy for over 200 years, to fall under the spell of nativist politics. But fall it did. The many Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and now find themselves protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone. On Sunday, while the American public was rapt in the Super Bowl, an astonishing sight came into focus in Romania. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption. The remarkable part was that protesters had already won. Demonstrations had begun six days earlier, after the government tried to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed from prison people convicted of corruption for amounts less than $47,000. The government agreed to rescind the order. But the demonstrations only grew, with protesters saying they came out to protect their democracy. Romanians knew they had to fight for democracy because of their recent communist past and the onslaught in neighboring countries against liberal democracy, which requires separation of powers, a free judiciary, free and fair elections and, yes, freedom to protest. Sadly, now, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the surge of refugee arrivals, demagogic politicians have leveraged popular discontent, lashing out against foreigners, vowing to put their country's ""true"" residents first, and gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy. Romanians seem to have won round one. But the forces defending democracy elsewhere, including in neighboring Hungary, have been losing. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly declared he's building an ""illiberal state,"" and is making strides in his quest to imitate regimes run by the likes of Putin. Democratic freedoms have suffered sharp reverses in recent years. Turkey is slipping into dictatorship, Venezuela remains mired in autocracy, as do countries in every continent. But what's ahead for the United States? Some veterans of the battle are pessimistic. When millions of mostly women took to the streets the day after Trump's inauguration, Julia Ioffe, whose family fled Russia, threw cold water on their jubilant movement, tweeting, ""The happy, feisty crowds, the clever signs - it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011. That went nowhere."" It's true that protests have not achieved much against other authoritarian regimes. In Venezuela, the Chavista regime came to power in 1999, and despite every effort from a determined opposition, it remains in power. In Turkey, mass demonstrations, and even what seemed like electoral victories, have failed to stop Recep Tayyip Erdogan's march to de facto dictator. In Russia, Putin is all but unchallenged, with a quiescent legislature and near-complete control of the news Russians consume. But the story is likely to have a different outcome in the United States. Yascha Mounk, a Harvard expert in right-wing populism, observed that Trump is turning out to be ""more authoritarian than I feared,"" though the opposition is also proving ""more courageous than I expected."" America has deeper democratic roots than any of the countries whose liberal democracies has been toppled. The national religion is freedom from tyranny. The day after Trump took office, Americans put on what may have been the largest national demonstration in the country's history. A week later, when Trump issued his travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries, spontaneous demonstrations materialized at major airports across the country. Lawyers filed legal briefs on the spot. While the Republican-controlled Congress has proven mostly silent in countering Trump's attacks on the independent media and the judiciary, the press appears determined to do its job and judges seem unintimidated by White House bullying. Even members of the executive branch are speaking out. Many Americans support Trump, but there are signs that his sharp break with democratic traditions, his attacks on judges, his fulminations against the media and against critics of all stripes -- from comedians to restaurant reviewers -- are producing a backlash. History is being written by two opposing forces -- those fighting for and those fighting against liberal democracy. President Trump's likening of America to Putin's Russia puts him on the illiberal side. But the American people have spent hundreds of years building a strong democratic system, and they are prepared to fight to defend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/opinions/trumps-moral-relativism-lucas-opinion/index.html,Trump has become Putin's ally in Russia's war on the West,"Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist, where he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He is also senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington, DC, think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.","""Whataboutism"" was a favorite Kremlin propaganda technique during the Cold War. It aimed to portray the West as so morally flawed that its criticism of the Soviet empire was hypocritical. Any criticism of the Soviet Union (the war in Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, persecution of dissidents) was met with a list of Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships, trampling trade unions, racial oppression). It was well encapsulated in a joke about the fictional Radio Yerevan (a staple of Soviet-era humor) in which a caller asks what is the average wage of an American manual worker. The real answer would undermine Soviet claims to economic superiority, so after a pause, the pundit replies: ""Over there they lynch Negroes."" By the time the system collapsed, that phrase had become a derisive synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole. ""Whataboutism"" seemed to have died in the 1990s when Russia's official aim was to become like the West. But it made a comeback under President Vladimir Putin, whose propaganda machine specializes in spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) in the West. If Americans, Britons, Germans and others can be made to believe that their rulers are crooks and idiots, and that legality and liberty are a sham, then they will be much less likely to take risks and make sacrifices in defending their own countries. To some extent, ""whataboutism"" is a sensible tactic in argument. Criticism delivered from a purported moral high ground deserves special scrutiny. We shouldn't take lessons from Russia about minority rights, say, given the way that the Kremlin mistreats its own indigenous populations -- Maris, Buryats, Komis and the like. But unlike Putin's Russia, the West is genuinely well placed to make such criticisms. We are not perfect. But we are self-critical and self-correcting. The cornerstone of our system is contestability. Of course, our elected representatives and government officials make mistakes -- but they are constrained and challenged for them. They risk civil and criminal legal actions, impeachment, media scrutiny, public protest and being tossed out of office into a lifetime of disgrace. These checks and balances are imperfect too, but they do work. President François Hollande has misruled France only mildly by Russian standards. But whereas he won't get a second term, President Putin can stay in office as long as he wants. President Trump has made an outrageous mistake in his visa ban and has immediately run into legal obstacles. When was the last time a Russian court told Putin that his actions were illegal? All this is lost on Trump. He appears to wish that America were more like Russia. He finds legal constraints on executive power outrageous. That view is not just mistaken: it is dangerous. All over the world, people look to America as a beacon of freedom and justice. It sets a standard (albeit sometimes a theoretical one) by which other political systems are judged. That represents a huge store of political capital. Trump is squandering it with every word he utters. Moral relativism corrodes sentiment in the frontline states of the new cold war. In places like Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, pro-Western figures are feeling that their struggle is doomed. Why bother fighting for freedom when the leader of the free world has given up? Worse than this, the thinking will spread that maybe Putin is right: the world is all about power and money, and the political currency that really works is coined from lies and fear. If those are the real rules of the game, then better to play them. It seems to have worked for Trump, after all.

51,2017/2/7,http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/opinions/sean-spicer-cupp/index.html,Sean Spicer has a problem: Melissa McCarthy,"S.E. Cupp is the author of ""Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity,"" co-author of ""Why You're Wrong About the Right"" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.","Let's hope these came in handy when he watched Melissa McCarthy parody the White House spokesman on ""Saturday Night Live"" over the weekend.  We all know his thin-skinned, humorless boss, President Donald Trump, has not taken kindly to SNL's countless spoofs, complaining on Twitter that SNL is ""unwatchable,"" ""totally biased"" and ""not funny."" He's also said that Alec Baldwin's impersonation ""just can't get any worse."" I happen to largely agree with that assessment. ""SNL"" has taken to merely mimicking Trump and his antics through Baldwin, rather than cleverly satirizing him. Despite plenty of material to work with, thus far, the Trump-SNL era has been, well, boring and predictable.  Until this weekend, that is. The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy's take on Spicer is that hers was actually hilarious.  A podium-wielding McCarthy plays on Spicer's rocky start at the White House -- his oratorical stumbles, his new, Trump-like scorn for critical press, his equally Trumpian fact-manipulation -- with a well-studied ear for his tics and tone.  Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like inside-the-beltway kind of humor that average viewers won't appreciate or find funny. But in the theatrical, reality-television era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too. And in this case, ""SNL"" writers didn't just mimic Spicer, they encapsulated a far bigger story: this is what it looks like when a normal, professional political operative becomes Trumpified. And if you didn't laugh out loud, you may have Trump's thin-skin disorder. But will Spicer follow his boss's lead, tweeting out how unfunny ""SNL"" is, or telling reporters that the show is biased and unwatchable? Not if he's smart, he won't.  If an ""SNL"" spoof is funny, there's only one way for the spoofee to handle it -- embrace it. At his next press briefing (Monday's was called off), where he will undoubtedly be asked about it, he should laugh it off, say he was flattered, and then make a joke at his own expense. He already took a crack at this approach in an interview with Extra on Sunday, telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy ""could dial back"" a bit, but also managing to call the show ""funny.""  If he can keep this up, he'd be following a long tradition of politicos taking parody in stride.  In 1995, House Republicans invited Chris Farley, who'd been impersonating Speaker Newt Gingrich on ""SNL,"" to impersonate him to his face at the conference meeting while Gingrich laughed along.  After spoofing George H.W. Bush for four years, Dana Carvey was invited to the White House to meet him. After Bush lost to Bill Clinton, he had Carvey come cheer up his staff.  In October of 2008, after Tina Fey spent weeks perfectly portraying then Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Palin appeared on ""SNL"" alongside Fey and Alec Baldwin, who ""mistakes"" her for Fey -- his former 30 Rock co-star -- and asks how she could appear on the show with the real Palin, ""that horrible woman.""  But that was all BT -- Before Trump. I know dozens of people in his new administration and many have become more like him, at least outwardly. They've become defensive, self-serious and aggressive, and they've adopted Trump's rhetorical penchant for hyperbole, bombast and fact-blurring. They say things publicly that I know they never would have said before. It seems like they're playing a part in a new Trump reality show. I wouldn't be surprised if Spicer reverts to Trump's lack of humor toward unflattering satire, just to stick to script. But that would make it infinitely worse. It's already problematic that the credibility of the White House and its staff is being lampooned only two weeks into the job. With the elevation of Trump political adviser Steve Bannon, some are wondering who are the cooler heads and saner voices surrounding the president. If the White House wants to allay these fears -- and perhaps they do not -- Spicer should be his cooler, saner, pre-Trump self, and play along with McCarthy's performance. Otherwise, the notion that Trump's White House can't take a joke gets a lot more serious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,2017/2/2,http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/world/myfreedomday-students-stand-up-to-slavery/index.html,#MyFreedomDay: Students stand up to slavery on March 14,"(CNN)Right now, between 21 and 45 million people are trapped in slavery. At least 5.5 million of those are children.","Although slavery is outlawed in every country, criminals earn more than $150 Billion every year from enslaving people.  But you can do something about it. On MARCH 14, 2017, we want YOU and your school to join us for #MyFreedomDay. We're asking students to organize events at their school on the day to highlight modern slavery and celebrate freedom. The schools that show the most spirit in fighting slavery will be featured on CNN TV, CNN.com and CNN Facebook. A few schools will even receive a visit from a CNN correspondent, who will report live from the school on the day. So how do you take part? We're encouraging students and teachers to come up with their own ideas, but here are some suggestions for the kind of thing you could do.  Film Screening - Look for movies or documentaries that deal with human trafficking. If you want to use a CNN documentary, we'll let you show it for free. You can watch the videos at cnn.com/myfreedom.  Art Show -- Create art work, in any media, and show it off at the school then post it to Twitter or Instagram using #MyFreedomDay. The theme can be anti-slavery and should include peaceful, hopeful messages; art work about survivors and traffickers, and any form of expression that highlights human trafficking in a way that will raise awareness to your community.  Stand for Freedom -- Students can stand for 45 mins (or 45 hours, if you're really dedicated!) to represent the 45 million victims of slavery in the world today.  Holi Day - The Indian Festival in March celebrates love and color to raise awareness and money. Festivities involve washable pigmented powders that can be thrown at each other. Add music and a booth for human trafficking information and you have a full day of fun for the community.  Panel Discussion -- Invite local lawmakers and anti-trafficking organizations to discuss the issue and what it looks like not just abroad, but in your hometown.  Day of Service -- Support a half-day of service where students volunteer at rehabilitation centers, visit their local lawmakers for a call to action, or collect items needed for survivors in conjunction with local organizations.  It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do something. Let us know your plans by telling us on Twitter or Instagram, using #MyFreedomDay. (You must be aged 13 or older to post on social media).  Find out more at cnn.com/myfreedom. And you can use the same hashtag to tell us what freedom means to you. - It could be the freedom to see your friends or family - Freedom to be yourself - Freedom to do the job you choose - Freedom to travel - Freedom to express yourself the way you choose  Whatever freedom means in your life -- the important thing is the message, and encouraging people to think about the freedom they may take for granted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,2016/12/21,http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/americas/costa-rica-migration/index.html,The other migrant crisis: Thousands risk journey through Latin America,"Paso Canoas, Costa Rica (CNN)Yolanda ticks off the countries she and her husband have passed through in the last three months: Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and now Costa Rica. But she is no tourist.","""A lot of roads, lots of bus rides, and a lot of walking too,"" she tells CNN, agreeing to be interviewed but asking that we only use her first name and not show her face. ""For a 7-month pregnant woman, that is a long, long time."" Yolanda says she is originally from Congo. She and her husband are among tens of thousands of migrants -- many from Africa and Haiti -- criss-crossing South and Central America trying to reach the United States. Now they're stuck in the border town of Paso Canoas, Costa Rica, waiting for the travel documents that will let them enter the country and continue their journey northward.  ""I hope to leave soon, for my turn to come fast so I can see a doctor,"" she says. ""I don't want my baby to be born on the road."" Read: Deadly crossing into Europe Long an obligatory stop on an important trade and tourist route, Paso Canoas has seen an unprecedented influx of migrants trekking north in recent months.  The huge surge in undocumented arrivals is a logistical and humanitarian nightmare for the government of Costa Rica.  ""At this moment Costa Rica is absolutely overwhelmed with our immigration situation and we're doing our best to protect the human rights of the people who are coming,"" said Mauricio Herrera Ulloa, the Costa Rican Communications Minister and point person for the migration crisis.  ""No one was prepared or was thinking about the possibility that we would receive 10,000 people from Haiti or Africa."" Perilous journeys Since April, when Costa Rica first started issuing transit visas for undocumented migrants, more than 18,000 people have crossed the border into the country. There are no comparative figures because the demand simply wasn't there in previous years so the visas didn't exist, officials say.  It is a situation that is being replicated in border towns throughout the Americas.  Experts say migrants are risking their lives in perilous journeys that expose them to crime and hunger and leave them vulnerable to human trafficking. ""They offer (migrants) something that they really need and in the case of these people, what they really need is to get one more border north,"" says Cy Winter, director of border management for the International Organization for Migration (IOM). More on human trafficking That means they often pay so-called coyotes for illegal border crossings -- breaking their ties to the state and public administration system. They often fall prey to false job offers ""just over the border.""  ""But then, on the other side, what's arranged there is completely different,"" says Winter. ""So they end up in a place where they have to work and they've got no way to get away from it."" 'Congo isn't a country, it's a password'  The IOM and other experts believe the majority of migrants are Haitians, many of them pretending to be Congolese in order to avoid deportation since it would be too costly for most Latin American countries to fly them to Africa. And in both Haiti and Congo, French is spoken.  ""The people I've spoken to claiming to be from Congo, barely know the capital and don't know the dialects that are spoken in the Congo and don't know the football jersey,"" said Winter.  According to the US Secretary of Homeland Security, some 40,000 Haitian migrants are working their way north, already overwhelming many border crossings into the United States.  Many of them entered Brazil as legal refugees after the 2010 earthquake. But the economic crisis in Brazil has made it increasingly difficult for migrants to get jobs, sparking an exodus. ""We've seen accumulations of up to 5,000 people on the border in various countries in South America so it is a concerning uptick in arrivals,"" said Winter.  One migrant I met on the Panamanian-Costa Rican border told me that every single one of the dozens of ""Congolese"" migrants milling about the migration office was actually from Haiti.  ""Here, Congo isn't a country, it's a password,"" he said, explaining that he and others destroy their passports so that they can re-invent themselves.  The bottlenecks at borders have raised serious concerns. The IOM has begun offering workshops at schools like Colegio Progreso -- in Panama, just across the border from Paso Canoas -- teaching students about the connection between migration and human trafficking.  In the past, the school was used as a shelter for hundreds of Cubans trying to make their way to the United States. The regional school director says she heard stories of women turning to prostitution in desperation.  ""In relation to the people being trafficked, we've heard horror stories,"" said Flor Bonilla.  In San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, Marilia Morales is just as worried. She founded the non-profit Rahab Foundation 20 years ago to rescue, rehabilitate and support survivors of sexual exploitation. Now she's launching a project on Costa Rica's northern border with Nicaragua.  ""We have an avalanche of people coming, we have Africans, Haitians, we have people coming from a lot of places,"" Morales told CNN.  ""We are in the process of training our personnel and we are going to be working with this community directly because they have to be aware that they could be victims of human trafficking, either for slave labor, sexual slavery and other ends,"" she said.  Nicaragua has closed its borders to undocumented migrants forcing thousands on the border into deplorable makeshift shelters and tent villages.  On Costa Rica's southern border, officials are trying to process migrants as quickly as possible. They're admitting 100-200 a day, but there is a long waiting list. In Yolanda's case, her hopes for a quick trip through Costa Rica were quickly dashed. Upon arrival, she was told she would have to wait six weeks just for an appointment with immigration officials.  Without the laissez-passer, she and her husband can't access the shelters set up by authorities in conjunction with the Red Cross -- warehouses and schools where migrants get free meals and a mattress to sleep on.  For the time being, they are sleeping in a makeshift hostel just a short walk from the border. They pay $5 a day and squeeze in with some 50 other people.  Yolanda says she left Congo for Brazil, where she worked in a restaurant for a year. She says both she and her husband lost their jobs in the recession -- just as they discovered she was pregnant. Now, their dream is for their daughter to be born in the United States.  But the odds are not in their favor. The money they borrowed from family back home is running out and she says they can't ask for more.  While Yolanda says she is from Congo, when I first met her, she couldn't at first remember or pronounce what she said was her hometown: Brazzaville, the capital of Congo.  When the time came to say goodbye to Yolanda and her husband, I couldn't help but wonder where they came from, and where this journey will ultimately take them.  Unfortunately for Haitians trying to make their way into the United States, officials recently eliminated the generous benefits and easy entry that were established after the 2010 earthquake.  Which means that even if they make it to the US border after months of travel and hardship, neither Haitian nor Congolese migrants are likely to get in.

54,2016/8/23,http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/world/canada-indigenous-sex-trafficking/index.html,Canada's stolen daughters: Sex traffickers target indigenous Canadians,"Winnipeg, Canada (CNN)As Lauren Chopek painfully details her story, she does so with the reticence of a survivor, as if somehow remaining silent would have been better.","""I used to blame myself for everything. But, like I, I would say I let them do that to me. I am dirty. It's my fault,"" says Chopek through tears. But Chopek is finally speaking out, determined to shake the guilt and shame that she knows should stalk her perpetrators instead of her. ""Now I see that I was just a child,"" says Chopek, now sitting serenely in a safe house, a healing lodge in rural Manitoba that cradled her in the love and protection she so needed when she escaped her life on the streets. Now 19, Lauren was just 14 when she was sexually exploited and trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg. But as an indigenous girl in Canada, her story is hardly rare. More from the CNN Freedom Project Canada's indigenous population is very small -- just 4% of the population -- yet more than 50% of all sex trafficking victims in Canada are indigenous. The reasons are complicated and varied but are ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty, racism and abuse. ""I was actually making these bad choices for a reason,"" explains Chopek. ""You know when you experience sexual abuse it's really confusing. You never know if it's your fault or is it theirs."" 'Targets of violence and abuse' Diane Redsky runs Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre, which advocates for indigenous women and children, specifically sex trafficking victims. Her organization runs the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed, as well as safe houses, rehabilitation and prevention programs throughout Manitoba. Read: Trafficked women tattooed by their pimps Redsky says the history of racism against indigenous Canadians feeds into the cycle of violence and exploitation against them. ""It's really difficult to be able to fight those stereotypes as indigenous women when a whole society is targeting indigenous women and girls, particularly for violence and abuse -- and that spills over into sex trafficking,"" says Redsky. Tanay Little's story shows how insidious the abuse can be. Little was just 11 when she was sexually exploited on the streets surrounding her family's home in Winnipeg. An older girl, someone who pretended to be her friend she says, was actually preying on Little, first luring her with drugs and then trafficking her for sex. ""I remember one time that she put me in a room and then two guys, one, not together, but one would come in and then I would have sex with him and then the other the other guy would come in. And then I'd get high after that,"" says Little. She is blunt about what would happen if she refused to have sex with anybody. ""If you're not beat up, then you would get raped by a few of them at once,"" explains Little. ""There is a debt bondage that's between $1,000 and $2,000 a day that these girls must bring, must hand in to their trafficker or else,"" says Redsky. These startling anecdotes have been heard in family homes, police stations and safe houses for years in Manitoba. The province is now taking the lead on an innovative approach to prevention and rehabilitation. Focus on the victims Redsky and others in Manitoba are now leading transformative programs to help identify the threats and risks so prevalent in indigenous communities. It is a new approach to help fight sex trafficking, one that focuses on the needs of the victims. Jennifer Richardson runs Tracia's Trust, Manitoba's strategy to combat sexual exploitation and sex trafficking of children. Crucially, Manitoba's government has committed more than $10 million Canadian a year to fund it, a huge sum for a population of only about a million people. ""Within a 10-year span Manitoba has really grown this massive strategy that is just recognized throughout Canada as being kind of the frontier leaders in this area,"" says Richardson. Read: 'I was raped 43,200 times' The program is different and revolutionary for Manitoba because it uses not only targeted funds, but also words, deeds, and training to fight human trafficking in a whole new way. Outreach on neighborhood streets is one strategy that is executed with the help of law enforcement officers. Almost daily, Winnipeg Police dispatch an elite unit on the streets to try and counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking. The approach is a departure for Winnipeg Police, who now say their efforts are firmly focused on helping victims. Outreach is conducted in a way to help victims and then bring their perpetrators to justice. Law enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism that in the past prevented police from truly understanding how and why indigenous girls are vulnerable and at risk. ""There is bias in the police service. We recognize it, that there's implicit bias. We certainly have taken steps to try to address that in a myriad of ways,"" says Danny Smyth, Winnipeg's deputy police chief. ""We have a team that's dedicated just to outreach. Just to being out there and trying to get to know who's out on the street, and trying to establish a relationship with them,"" adds Smyth. The legacy of years of abuse and racism though are making it difficult for Canada's indigenous community to heal and move on. Canada will soon launch an inquiry that will focus on why hundreds of indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been murdered over the years. Canadian and independent studies have revealed that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than non-indigenous women and girls. ""We're still in a society that targets indigenous women and girls. In fact the national task force concluded that there's a market for indigenous girls,"" says Redsky, adding, ""what that leads to is a society who views indigenous women as less than, and in fact of no human value.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,2016/4/22,http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/us/project-vic-child-abuse/index.html,How child predator was caught by tiny clue in photo he posted online,"(CNN)In a bathroom, the predator has placed a child on the counter to photograph his evil acts.","In the background of the photo, which was posted online, are products including prescription medication. But zooming in on that pill bottle makes the details unreadable. In a small, dark lab Jim Cole, special agent and supervisor of Victim Identification at the Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center gets to work using the latest technology available. Using technology to identify abusers ""Utilizing some technology that hadn't even been released to the public yet we were able to take a look at the bottle and reverse out some of the motion blur,"" Cole said. They can now see the offender's first name ""Stephen,"" the first two letters of the last name and the first three digits on the prescription order. With that he applies to the pharmacy for the customer details of every person who fits that criteria. It narrows the list down to a man named ""Stephen Keating."" But that's not all. The offender's fingers are also in the picture and incredibly this crack team manages to pull the fingerprints from the image. ""That was the first time we were able to do that,"" Cole said. The evidence was strong enough to put Stephen Keating behind bars for 110 years. Investigators rescued his 14 victims. No victim left behind Cole co-founded Project VIC: their aim is that no victim is be left behind. ""We strive to find these children as quick as possible,"" Cole said. ""The longer it takes us the longer that child is in harm's way."" Read: Raid reunites trafficked sisters It's not an easy task when Cole says they are seeing 500,000 images a week: that's over 25 million a year. The Keating case ran for about three weeks and in the past it could have taken months -- or worse, the image may never have been uncovered at all. Using technology known as ""Photo DNA"" their computers can wade through the hundreds of thousands of photos fast, categorizing the ones they've already seen to allow his team to focus on the new victims. ""What used to take us nine months now takes us a month,"" said Cole. ""It helps us review video on a scale of about 100 times faster than previously,"" he added. ""It's been a complete game-changer for law enforcement and we get that feedback from the field all the time."" Easing psychological burden The efficiency not only saves time, it helps ease the psychological burden on investigators. ""We definitely see a mental health benefit because the nature of our offenders is they are trading material we've seen hundreds of thousands of times in addition to the new material,"" Cole said. Read: Vietnamese girls smuggled in to China, sold as brides The technology helped investigators find a seemingly harmless photo of a known offender with her victim on vacation. The image showed the pair holding fish at a campsite. The fish were isolated from the image and sent to Cornell University, which provided investigators with a geographical area where those fish can be caught. The campsite image, with the child and perpetrator removed, was sent to every single campsite advertiser in that location. Upon tracking down the actual campsite they found the same photo posted in the reception room. ""Within four hours we had her identified,"" Cole said. The child was rescued and the woman is now serving a 25-year sentence. On another image of an offender with a young girl, the Project VIC team noticed a company logo on the man's sweatshirt but they couldn't decipher what was written. Some cutting edge technology helped make the logo almost completely readable. An online search for names that might match the letters led investigators to a plumbing business. The offender, a former employee, was tracked down and four victims were rescued. Global problem The number of images like these being shared online is on the rise. Last year the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received 4.4 million reports to its CyberTipline. That's a nearly 800% increase in reporting since 2013. Tip-offs come from the public, and also companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, who are mandated by U.S. regulations to report any such images. According to Lindsay Olson, director of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC, 94% of the cases last year were outside the United States. ""The CyberTipline receives reports of child porn, online enticement of children for sexual acts, online sex trafficking, child molestation; any type of child exploitation can be reported to the cyber tip line,"" said Olson. ""We make reports available to law enforcement in about 100 countries and we also work with Europol and Interpol."" Swedish based company Griffeye was one of the founding partners of Project VIC. Director Johann Hofmann says it donates its software to be used in child exploitation cases. ""As more and more crime is becoming more and more digital as data is being distributed online,"" he said. ""You see a new type of police officer that is behind a computer screen and with the right tools they can crack these cases."" The Internet has no borders so law enforcement agencies need to overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together. Project VIC is now being used by Interpol, Europol and agencies in 35 countries including the United Kingdom and Canada, and it's about to be rolled out in Australia. In the United States the results speak for themselves. ""We've been absolutely floored by the success we've seen with Project VIC,"" said Cole. ""Going back a few years we were seeing victims in the low hundreds and in this past year we've rescued over 1,000 victims just in HSI (Homeland Security Investigations -- a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)). alone and we've seen similar results in other agencies as well.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,2016/4/19,http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/17/asia/vietnamese-girls-child-brides-china/index.html,Vietnamese girls smuggled into China and sold as child brides,The names of the trafficked girls in this story have been changed to protect their identities.,"Lan remembers the night that changed her whole life. While preparing for university along the border in northern Vietnam, a friend she met online asked her to a group dinner. When she was tired and wanted to go home, the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink. Next thing she knew, she had been smuggled across the border to China. ""At that time, I wanted to leave,"" says Lan. ""There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us."" The villages along the Vietnamese-Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers. Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged, then spirited across the porous border by boat, motorbike or car. Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China, where the one-child policy and long-standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio. To put it simply, Chinese men are hungry for brides. ""It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman,"" explained Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam. Traditionally, Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding. ""This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries, including Vietnam."" Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam. She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3,000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese. Nguyen was just 16 when a friend's boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China. She tried to resist a forced marriage. For three months, she refused, even though her traffickers beat her, withheld food and threatened to kill her, she says. Finally, she relented. She says her husband was kind to her, but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam. ""My desire to go home was indescribable,"" Nguyen said. ""I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him."" When her mother-in-law realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage, the family returned her to the traffickers. They got their money back, Nguyen says, after which she was forced into a second marriage. A refuge for escaped women The Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai, northern Vietnam. The young women stay for an average of two to three years. They go to school or get vocational training. They do art therapy. They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden. Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences, the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves. ""Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives,"" says Diep. Her organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers. About once a month, a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha, a regional hub for buying food, fabric and livestock. On this day, on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers, they talk about their experiences, take questions and play games with the crowd. When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking, more than 20 people come forward. ""I think awareness is the only tool,"" Diep says. Ha from the U.N. agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness, especially in the poor, rural regions along the border. She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work, another common way traffickers lure victims. Saved at the border During CNN's trip to the border, the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker. We met the girls, who are just 14 years old. They said they were promised $600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village. They didn't tell their parents they were going. The neighbor is now under arrest. The Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China, by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities. Nguyen Tuong Long, the head of the government's social vice prevention department in Lao Cai, says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims. ""Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police, we have found and caught trafficking rings,"" Nguyen says. ""We've found women far inside China, at brothels where they're forced to become sex workers."" Trafficked women who aren't rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own. Some of them say they were able to contact their families from China, but they couldn't get help from police because they didn't know exactly where they were. Lan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China. After two years, together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station. The whole time they were afraid their husbands' families would find them. The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam. The women were free of their forced marriages, but they paid a high price. Both left their babies in China. Lan says if she saw her daughter again, she would apologize for leaving her behind. ""I hope she'll have a better life there,"" she says. Both Lan and Nguyen say in school their teachers had talked to them about trafficking. At the time, neither believed it could happen to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He hosted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a proponent of the autism theory, in January at Trump Tower in New York City. Kennedy said afterward that Trump had asked him to head a commission investigating vaccine safety.- A Trump spokeswoman previously said no decision had been made about whether to create a commission. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.-- Public health groups have been wary of wading into the political fray on vaccines, reluctant to give the impression that there's any legitimate debate among scientists over whether people should have their children immunized. The letter had been in the works since Trump's vaccine doubts resurfaced last month, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Several government bodies already vouch for the safety of vaccines, and nongovernment researchers have repeatedly probed the link between vaccines and autism since a 1998 paper first caused alarm.

Researchers found that people who switched from smoking regular cigarettes to e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) such as gum or patches for at least six months had much lower levels of toxins in their saliva and urine than those who continued to smoke. ""ourstudy adds to existing evidence showing that e-cigarettes and NRT are far safer than smoking, and suggests that there is a very low risk associated with their long-term use,""?said Lion Shahab, a specialist in epidemiology and public health at University College London who led the work. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor, have grown into an $8 billion-a-year market, according to Euromonitor International - more than three times that of NRT products. They are, however, still dwarfed by a tobacco market estimated by Euromonitor to be worth around $700 billion. Many health experts think e-cigarettes, or vapes, which do not contain tobacco, are a lower-risk alternative to smoking and potentially a major public health tool. But some question their long-term safety and worry that they may act as a ""gateway""?to taking up conventional cigarettes. The U.S. surgeon general in December urged lawmakers to impose price and tax policies that would discourage their use. Monday's study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed saliva and urine samples from long-term e-cigarette and NRT users as well as smokers, and compared levels of key chemicals found in their bodies. It found that smokers who switched completely to e-cigarettes or NRT had significantly lower levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogens compared to people who continued to smoke tobacco cigarettes. Those who used e-cigarettes or NRT but did not completely quit smoking did not show the same drop in toxin levels. This underlined that a complete switch was needed to get the long-term health benefits of quitting tobacco, the researchers said. The World Health Organization says tobacco is the world's biggest preventable killer, with a predicted cumulative death toll of a billion by the end of this century if current trends continue. Tobacco smoking currently kills around 6 million people a year. Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at the government authority Public Health England, said the findings held a clear message for tobacco smokers. ""Switching to e-cigarettes can significantly reduce harm to smokers, with greatly reduced exposure to carcinogens and toxins,""?he said in a statement. ""the findings also make clear that the benefit is only realized if people stop smoking completely and make a total switch. ""the best thing a smoker can do, for themselves and those around them, is to quit now, completely and forever.""?(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-us/should-scientists-engage_b_14636016.html,Should scientists engage in activism?,,"By Ivan Oransky, New York University and Adam Marcus, Johns Hopkins University Have you heard that scientists are planning a march on Washington? The move is not being billed as a protest, but rather as a ""celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community,"" although it comes as a direct response to recent policy changes and statements by the Trump administration. Not everyone thinks the nonprotest protest is a good thing. It's ""a terrible idea,"" wrote Robert Young, a geologist at Western Carolina University, in The New York Times. The march, Young said, will just reinforce a belief among some conservatives that ""scientists are an interest group,"" and polarize the issue, making researchers' jobs more difficult. Others find that argument less than convincing, pointing out that science and politics have always been intertwined. As the founders of the blog Retraction Watch and the Center for Scientific Integrity, we often see researchers reluctant to push for or embrace change - whether it's to the conventional way of dealing with misconduct in journals (which for years was basically to not do so) or addressing problems of reproducibility of their experiments. To the timorous, airing dirty laundry, and letting the public in on the reality of science, could endanger public trust - and funding. So this isn't the first time scientists and engineers have voiced similar concerns. Take the example of Marc Edwards and his colleagues at Virginia Tech: To many people watching the Flint water crisis, they were heroes. After being asked to visit by concerned residents, they found, and announced, that people in the beleaguered city were being exposed to excessive amounts of lead through their tap water. They also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for water filters for city residents and created a website to push their findings about the hazards of the city's water supply and shame governments at all levels to act. If not for their tireless efforts, thousands of children may have been exposed to dangerous amounts of lead for far longer than they already were. Even the Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged that it waited too long to sound the alarm.   But that's not exactly how the editor of a leading engineering journal sees things. In October, a remarkable editorial appeared in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The essay, by University of California, Berkeley engineering professor and Water Center Director David Sedlak, ES&T's editor-in-chief, expressed concern that some of his colleagues in the field had crossed the ""imaginary line"" between scientist and advocate. ""Speaking out against a corrupt or incompetent system may be the product of a culture where idealism, personal responsibility, and Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities conspire to create a narrative about the noble individual fighting injustice,"" Sedlak wrote. By becoming ""allies of a particular cause, no matter how just, we jeopardize the social contract that underpins the tradition of financial support for basic research."" In other words, don't cross Congress - which many scientists already view as hostile to their profession - and risk retaliation in the form of budget cuts. That's no small pie, either. Through its oversight of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Energy and other agencies and programs, Congress holds the strings to a research purse worth nearly US$70 billion a year.  Let's take a moment to absorb all that. Some (unnamed but easily identified) scientists, lulled by the media, have cast themselves as superheroes in a struggle against villains born of their own conceit. Their arrogance and vanity threaten to awaken the master, who will punish us all for the sins of a few. We rarely get the opportunity to watch a chilling effect in action, but you can almost see the breath of researchers caught up in a debate over the proper role of scientists in the crisis. It's not just engineers who fear speaking out. ""We have too often been reluctant to voice our protest, for fear of incurring the [National Institute of Mental Health's] displeasure (and losing whatever opportunities we still have for funding),"" wrote neuroscientist John Markowitz in The New York Times last fall. In a refreshing piece, Markowitz was arguing that ""there's such a thing as too much neuroscience."" As cofounders of Retraction Watch, a blog that focuses on some of science's nasty episodes, we are occasionally admonished that pointing out cases of fraud - even when we also praise good behavior - will give anti-science forces ammunition. In some ways, we should be glad scientists are acknowledging these concerns, instead of pretending they're never swayed by the almighty dollar. But anyone who clings to the notion that science exists in a pure vacuum, untainted by politics, economics or social justice needs also to understand that science is a human endeavor and scientists have the same eyes and ears for injustice and outrage as the rest of us. Although the conduct of science demands honesty and rigor, nowhere is it written that researchers must remain silent when governments or other powerful players either misuse science or suppress findings in the service of harmful policies. And before Edwards and his efforts on behalf of the Flint community, some scientists have spoken out. Claire Patterson, a physical chemist, put himself on a decades-long collision course with industry when he took on lead poisoning. John Snow earned the ire of Londoners when he removed the pump handle on a cholera-infested well, and wasn't vindicated until after his death. It took Peter Buxtun several years to stop the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment; he eventually had to leak documents to reporter Jean Heller in 1972. Edwards and his colleagues, we would argue, are part of a long tradition of bridging the worlds of science and policy. They have been instrumental in bringing not only attention but change to the beleaguered city of Flint. And money: Thanks in part to their pressure, the Senate in September voted overwhelmingly to approve $100 million in aid for Flint, and hundreds of millions more in loans from the Environmental Protection Agency for upgrading municipal water infrastructures and studying exposure to lead.   In a stinging rebuke to Sedlak, Edwards and three coauthors - Amy Pruden, Siddhartha Roy and William Rhoads - blasted the critical editorial as a ""devastating, self-indictment of cowardice and perverse incentives in modern academia."" Indeed, scientists who accept funding with the tacit agreement that they keep their mouths shut about the government are far more threatening to an independent academy than those who speak their minds. Since Nov. 8, it has been painfully clear that science will be playing defense for a while. The United States has never seen a regime so hostile to science and the value of the scientific method. President Donald Trump has declared climate change a ""hoax"" cooked up by the Chinese. He has flirted seriously with debunked anti-vaccination views and declared that polls (read, data) that are negative about his ambitions are ""fake news."" Science and politics are not always compatible. And science need not always triumph over policy: After all, research shows that steroids improve athletic performance, but we have a compelling political interest to ban them. The same can be said of eugenics. Research must always be ethical, and ethics is a conversation that includes scientists and policymakers. Still, while the two domains are separate, the divide is, and should be, bridgeable. As Edwards and his colleagues write, ""The personal and professional peril is great, the critics are numerous and vocal, but staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice. And no matter what may come of the rest of our lives or careers, we are certain of one thing: Flint was a community worth going out on a limb for, and by upholding a just cause, we enhanced the social contract between academics and the public."" That could easily be said of the March for Science. Except now it's not just a limb but the entire tree that's in peril.

62,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/madelaine-dangelo/how-to-minimize-risks-and_b_14635990.html,How to Minimize Risks and Maximize Returns in Art Investments,,"Many investors interested in alternative assets often shy away from art due to the overwhelming amount of risks and responsibilities that come with acquiring investment grade art. In this article, we identify these risks, and tell you how investing in art through Arthena will make you want to start today. Comparables, Experience and Costs: Needless to say, investment grade art is not the stock market or the real estate market where you can compare prices of one asset to another. With art assets, the ability to determine the legitimacy and the price, comes with expertise - this barrier makes it difficult for the traditional investor to confidently invest. When evaluating a work of art, art appraisers look for: Authenticity, condition, rarity, provenance, and value. Art appraisers' expertise can charge anywhere between $50 dollars to several hundreds of dollars an hour, and not all have equivalent experiences. Additional time is needed to ween out truly experienced art appraisers from those who are not. How can Arthena help? By investing through Arthena, we take away all the troubles of doing your own research, determining which work to purchase, placing the right bid, and hiring the right appraiser. At Arthena, we use our very own regression analysis to determine works of art to purchase for investment purposes. We organize artworks with similar core characteristics into logical groups according to their specific criteria, in accordance with USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) guidelines, which is also known as a IRS appraisal. The characteristics include artist, genre, date range, content, materials, size, coloration, and style, among others. Then, Arthena targets works by artists that have shown appreciation over the past 5 years and are projected to grow by 20% +/- YoY over the next five, or the lifetime of the fund. From storage to insurance, Arthena takes all these burdens away from the traditional art investor. By investing a minimum of $10k into our funds, we handle every troublesome task when it comes to acquiring a work of art. Just sit back, and watch your investment grow. Illiquidity: Generally, the art market is relatively illiquid in comparison to traditional assets such as equities and stocks. Therefore, art assets are ideal for long-term investments. That being said, there is varying liquidity within the art market itself. Determined by the difference between the ask and bid price, the lower the bid price from the ask price, the more illiquid the asset is. The greater the bid is from the ask price, the more liquid it is. Let Arthena identify the art market's most liquid assets: Arthena acquires works in the emerging, PWC, and Modern market sectors, which in total account for over 70% of the US market, and have shown the highest rate of growth over the past 10 years. Art market analysts have identified the most liquid sector of the art market are works of art under $250,000. Arthena confirms that the artist and art work fit our growth metrics, rate at 1 or above for Sharpe Ratio, to confirm that it is a high growth investment with low volatility, and determine its maximum acquisition price Lack of Data: Many reports have noted upon the lack of transparency in the art market. As a result, companies have created indices such as Mei Moses and Artnet index to amend this ""problem"". Nonetheless, these indices bring in a new set of issues. Such indices as the two mentioned do not encompass the entire art market. For example, Mei Moses's data lies primarily on numbers from Sotheby's and Christie's, negating their online sales as well as other auction houses and private sales. Another problem is that some indexes rely heavily on repeat sales, but does not include bought in lots, which variates some data. How Arthena operates through transparency: As such, Arthena acquires works at auction for increased price transparency to the benefit of our investors and our methodology. When works from Arthena's index of artists appear at auction, Arthena uses regression modeling to determine maximum acquisition price. Once acquired, investors can view their art collection through Arthena's online dashboard, allowing our clients to have full access into their investments.  Stock market vs. art market performance: Multiple art market analysts have determined that the art market has a low correlation to the stock market, while other analysts have deemed that there is still a certain level of correlation between the two because of the notion that investors would only spend disposable income on collectibles and luxury assets when the market is bullish rather than vice versa. Regardless, the art market has proven itself to be a great store of wealth especially during times of economic uncertainty. Notably, it only took the art market 16 months to return to pre-recession levels in 2008, while the stock market took six years. As such, according to Deloitte: ""Increasing awareness of art as an asset class: 53% of wealth managers had a high level of awareness of developments linked to art as an asset class, up from 43% in 2012 and 33% in 2011; this signals that increasing attention is being paid by the wealth management community to the art and collectibles market."" - Deloitte and ArtTactic Art & Finance Report 2014  Arthena takes a new approach to investing in art. Like a hedge fund, Arthena identifies specific market segments and artists that have shown impressive historical performance and creates buy orders to acquire said works.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) hopes President Donald Trump would be receptive to a paid family leave plan because his daughter has spoken about the issue.,"WASHINGTON ""?Progressives wondering whether President Donald Trump will give any notice to their concerns hold out hope that his daughter Ivanka will intervene. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a longtime champion of paid family leave, on Tuesday reintroduced her Family Act, which would guarantee 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers. The legislation, which proposes a universal paid leave program funded by a small payroll tax, failed to advance in the previous session of the Republican-led Congress, and likely faces the same fate under Trump. But Gillibrand and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), sponsor of a companion bill in the House, on Tuesday expressed optimism that the president would be receptive, in part because Ivanka Trump has spoken about the issue. ""I am hopeful that the administration will reach out to me and work with me on a national paid leave plan,""?Gillibrand said on a call with reporters. Gillibrand referenced Ivanka Trump's speech at last summer's Republican National Convention, in which she presented her father, who has a record of demeaning women, as a champion for women's rights and a supporter of equal pay for women. It led many progressives to hope that her influence would encourage-""?or at least make it possible ""?that the president pivot from his campaign promises. Ivanka Trump also tried during the campaign to deflect attention away from her father's history of misogyny and climate change denial. Last week, Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser, reportedly convinced the president not to roll back LGBTQ protections, a important achievement of former President Barack Obama. Trump's proposed paid leave plan, like most of his policy proposals, contains little substance and is limited in scope. It allows for six weeks of paid leave, and only applies to mothers. Ivanka Trump said in an interview when her father's leave plan was announced in September that it is intended to ""help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth.""?She would not elaborate on whether it would apply to LGBTQ, adoptive or foster parents, or people caring for aging parents. ""we'll wait to see what the dimensions of it, what the details are,""?DeLauro said of Trump's proposal.- ""I don""t know when they will move forward with making a substantive proposal,""?she added. ""We'r waiting for them to join the debate. We'r on the field. The U.S. remains the only industrialized country without mandated paid family leave. Sunday was the 24th anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave for people who work at companies with more than 50 employees. The push for universal paid leave is growing, with state legislatures and businesses enacting more expansive plans. Gillibrand said she hopes to gain bipartisan support because the issue affects everyone. ""Despite the fact that we don""t have a Republican yet, I am optimistic that people will be demanding action on this issue, that people will rise up and say we need a national paid leave plan, and really call on their elected leaders to listen to the challenges that they'r facing,""?Gillibrand said. ""I am hopeful that the new administration will focus on it because they did run on it, they did talk about it, and it should be nonpartisan.""?,-1""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) also pointed to ""the good things"" that came from the shooting of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.","Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) vehemently defended President Donald Trump's ban on refugees and travelers Tuesday, arguing that terrorists who come from the Middle East are an existential threat to the United States and totally different from white domestic terrorists,-who just commit ""Ane-off""?incidents that the government can""t do anything about.- Duffy said Trump was justified in stopping Syrian refugees from entering the United States ""until in Syria they figure out this conflict in the civil war and this hotbed for terrorism.""?Presumably, however, once the conflict is over, women and children, for example, won""t feel it is as necessary to escape their country to find a safe haven.- Host Alisyn Camerota pressed Duffy on Trump claiming that the media were intentionally covering up terrorist attacks and either not reporting or underreporting them. The White House later Monday released a list of 78 attacks it said backed up Trump's claim. The list notably did not include a recent attack on Muslims inside a Quebec City mosque that killed six people. Trump, who frequently tweets about terrorist attacks, also has not mentioned this one.- Duffy argued in his CNN interview that attacks by white people ""?such as the one in Quebec City ""?aren""t as big of a problem.- ""You don""t have a group like ISIS or al Qaeda that is inspiring people around the world to take up arms and kill innocents. That was a one-off. That was a one-off, Alisyn,""?Duffy said. Camerota then pointed to the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, as acts carried out by white terrorists. Duffy tried to make lemonade out of the Charleston attack, in which a white supremacist killed nine people:- CAMEROTA: How about Charleston, congressman? He was an extremist. He was a white extremist?- DUFFY: Yes, he was. OK? CAMEROTA: How about that? That doesn""t matter?- DUFFY: No, it does matter. It does matter. Look at the good things that came from it. [Then-South Carolina Gov.] Nikki Haley took down the Confederate flag, that was great.- But you want to say I can give you a couple of examples. There's no constant threat that goes through these attacks. And you have radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS that are driving the attacks, and if you want to compare those two, maybe you can throw another one ""��?CAMEROTA: You can.- Duffy claimed that people on the left were manufacturing outrage, saying there was plenty of blame to go around.- ""Look at Gabby Giffords. The Marxist, who took her life, a leftist guy, and now you see violence and terror in the streets all across America, burning and beating people with Donald Trump hats. The violence you have to look in, you'r trying to use examples on the right,""?he said. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) is not dead. As a congresswoman in 2011, she survived an assassination attempt, and she remains an outspoken proponent of gun safety reform. Duffy said he be happy to help do something about white supremacy but he just didn""t know what to do: ""Can we vet that? How should we vet that to keep ourselves safe? I will join you in that effort, what do you do?""?- Watch Duffy's full interview below:- Camerota: Why isn't the president talking about white terrorism? Duffy: There's a difference. https://t.co/YEgSitUsdS The Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked radical-right terrorist plots that have occurred since the Oklahoma City bombing and has a list here.- There have been zero fatal terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since 1975 by immigrants from the seven countries listed in Trump's executive order. The order restricts travelers from those countries from coming to the U.S. for 90 days, prevents refugees from all countries from entering the U.S. for 120 days and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely.

66,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/02/07/6-things-i-learned-from-being-ghosted_n_14635944.html,I Was Ghosted 3 Times In The Last Year. Here Are 6 Things I Learned.,Hello? Helllllllllllllo?,"Ah, dating in the 21st century. If disappointing websites, drug-resistant STIs and troublingly short attention spans weren""t enough to make us lose our minds (and possibly our libidos), we'r also now stuck grappling with another modern phenomenon: ghosting. The New York Times defines ghosting as ""ending a romantic relationship by cutting off all contact and ignoring the former partner's attempts to reach out.""?This has happened to me three times in the past year. Granted, I don""t believe it necessarily needs to be a ""relationship""?in the traditional sense in order for one party to be ghosted. It could (or should) also include entanglements that involved meeting up or hanging out or hooking up with someone two or more times before the other person vanished without a trace. I haven""t been in a formal relationship in almost four years, but I frequently meet guys that I find worthy of getting to know better (both with and without my clothes on) and the exchanges that result from those interactions are meaningful to me in one way or another ""?at least meaningful enough to want some closure if or when they end. After investing some time and energy and possibly saliva or other body fluids in another person, it's disconcerting when they suddenly disappear. Of course, if you're only been on one or two ""dates""?(however you want to define that term) with someone and at the end of your time together neither of you reaches out to the other, that's not ghosting. That's just life.-And I understand that dating is hard and that finding someone who ticks ""?or if we'r really lucky, tickles ""?all of our boxes is virtually impossible but I still (perhaps naively) cling to the (perhaps now radical and totally outdated) idea that it's a mature move to give someone a heads up if you'r going to stop talking or seeing or fucking them. So, in light of my experiences over the past year, here are a few humble and totally unscientific thoughts on ghosting: 1. Just don""t do it. Be an adult and send a text that reads something like: ""Hey. Glad we hung out but I'm just not feeling a connection. Stay awesome""?or whatever other generic and possibly hurtful or patronizing or maybe just uncomfortable (but at least emotionally clear) and instructive language you want to use. I'll respect you for it even if it bums me out and that way neither of us has to dread randomly running into the other at Whole Foods or at that bar with all those vintage pinball machines that I stupidly and regretfully introduced you to because I thought you were cool (or at least we won""t experience more than the usual basic human level of dread that accompanies those kinds of surprise social interactions). 2. If you do it, do not ""?as two of the three guys who originally ghosted me have done ""?start texting me again three to four weeks later and pretend like nothing happened as if you unexpectedly slipped into a coma and then suddenly woke up again or went on a hot air balloon trip around the world and didn""t have access to your phone and just forgot to tell me. The only thing worse than ghosting is re-materializing a month later ""?and I mean worse for both of us because at that point, I""ve had all that time to think about how bad your taste in music actually is or question a million other questionable things you told me in our short time together and now that I""ve thought about it, I don""t want to see you again. 3. Being ghosted made me realize I""ve probably ghosted guys in the past-(and now that I'm publishing this piece, I'm guessing one or two or 74 of you will come forward and say as much). If I ghosted you, I'm sorry. I was an asshole. I was immature. And I was probably scared of hurting your feelings or just didn""t know how to verbalize why I didn""t want to see you again. Chances are it was something innocuous and had nothing to do with your character. And I'm sure if you asked any of the guys who ghosted me, they say exactly the same things. But that doesn""t excuse it and going forward I'm vowing taking my own advice, no matter how awkward it might feel. 4. Human beings are finicky creatures and, what's more, as our cultural ideas about and understanding of what dating and relationships and couples and families look like continues to shift and destabilize,-linking up and breaking apart is probably only going to get trickier. These days many of us aren""t looking to get married or have kids (or at least aren""t looking to get married and have kids the way our parents or our grandparents-did) and so, the way we think about how we enter and exit relationships is mutating and not always in ideal ways, which means we have to be even more mindful of our (in)actions. 5. Communicating is hard ""?and getting harder.-As much as I think the guys who ghosted me suck, I get it. And in many ways, aside from reminding me to treat others the way I'd like to be treated, being ghosted also has made me rethink who and what I'm looking for in a partner or a fuck buddy ""?or just someone I want to go and have a donut with. What's more, it's made me rethink how I communicate with other human beings in general and reevaluate what the best way is to express myself and my needs and my desires to friends and family and colleagues, too. Email and texts make it easy to send a message but we have to stop to think about the quality of those messages. And are those forms of communication appropriate for what we need to say?-What is the value of face to face contact and experiencing the world offline? What are the best ways to grow a relationship and how often do I rely on technology as a crutch to deal with ""?or get out of ""?something? These are all questions that have been pacing the hallways in my head lately and it feels good (or at least productive) to think about them. 6. Ghosting aside, there's something kind of nice about dating as a 38-year-old because I know what I want better than I did when I was 25 or even 32 and I put up with less shit. And if, in the end, someone doesn""t text me back, the truth is I'm totally happy to spend Friday night watching ""the Great British Bakeoff""?all by myself (maybe, if I'm being totally honest, even happier).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/02/06/orthodox-women-clergy_n_14635938.html,"Despite Ban, These Orthodox Jewish Clergywomen Are Determined To Serve",Not even a ban from the religious establishment will stop these women from fulfilling their calling.,"The Orthodox Union, one of the largest-networks of Orthodox Jewish synagogues in America, recently adopted a policy that bans women from serving as clergy.- Opinions about whether women should be allowed to serve as clergy have caused some division within America's Modern Orthodox Jewish community. The religious establishment, including the OU's counterpart, the Rabbinical Council of America,-is strongly opposed to women's ordination.-On the other hand, some OU synagogues have embraced the idea of women clergy. The new policy attempts to clear up the confusion. But despite the enforcement of this glass ceiling, Orthodox women who have felt the pull to serve as spiritual leaders aren""t backing away from their calling.- Rabba Sara Hurwitz is the co-founder and Dean of Yeshivat Maharat, an-Orthodox Jewish seminary that ordains women as clergy. The school has graduated 14 female clergy and 28 others are currently students. Hurwitz told The Huffington Post that nine of the their graduates are currently employed in synagogues. She said students remain committed to ""learning, teaching, being a pastoral presence for people in their time joy and vulnerability, and being a role model for others.""?""their reaction [to the policy] is to keep marching forwards, fulfilling their passion to become clergy,""?she wrote in an email. The OU's decision comes down to a difference in opinion about God's will for men and women. According to a statement, OU leaders said that they had been approached by Orthodox rabbis and lay leadership for definitive guidance about women's ordination. The OU placed the question in front of a group of seven modern Orthodox rabbis. After months of reviews and forums with community members, the panel concluded that more should be done to encourage women towards leadership positions. However, their interpretation of Jewish law found that men and women have-different gender roles and obligations when it comes to serving in a synagogue. OU leaders argued that the idea of gender equality in religious practice ""inexorably clashes""?with the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish scripture. In their worldview, individual autonomy must always submit to the will of God, as interpreted by rabbinic leaders. The rabbis agreed that women can serve as administrators, educators, and counselors. They can even advise other women about Jewish law as it relates to marriage, sexuality and women's health.- But on the matter of ordination, the rabbis concluded that women weren""t allowed. As a result, the OU adopted a policy on February 1 that discourages-member synagogues from employing-women clergy, or allowing women to perform tasks typically associated with clergy ""� such as officiating at significant life-cycle events, delivering sermons from the pulpit, and serving as a synagogue's primary religious teacher. Instead of focusing on what women are prohibited from doing, the leaders asked the community to focus on what women are allowed to do.- ""Women must be encouraged to share their Torah knowledge, and their enthusiasm and wisdom, with the broader community,""?the leaders said in a statement. ""Let us focus our energy and communal creativity on increasing and enhancing the contributions that women make to our shuls and communities, rather than being consumed with limitations.""?But some female Orthodox clergy are determined not to let these restrictions stop them from acting as spiritual leaders. Maharat Ruth Balinsky Friedman, an ordained spiritual leader at Washington D.C.'s Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue, told The Huffington Post that she's determined to keep doing her job. ""I am grateful to have an extremely supportive community, and so this decision does not affect me personally. However, some of my colleagues are personally affected, and this decision caused them a lot of upset and worry,""?she told The Huffington Post in an email. ""therefore, my top reaction is one of anger.-That these rabbis made this decision without considering the effects it would have on the women who are currently serving as clergy, or who are training to serve, is disgraceful.""?The OU's statement does not explicitly state whether the rabbinic panel listened to ordained women's voices and opinions during the review process. The Huffington Post's requests for comment were not returned. The Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, a group that advocates for expanded roles for women within the community, was ""dismayed""?by the OU's decision.- ""there are various ways of practicing Judaism, halachic Orthodox Judaism,""?Sharon Weiss-Greenberg, the group's executive director, told the Forward. ""We are disappointed, however, that the OU is attempting to squash that healthy debate and impose their [religious ruling] on hundreds of synagogues, thus centralizing power""?and not giving autonomy to communities""?lay and professional leaders.""?Bracha Jaffe, a member of Yeshivat Maharat's Class of 2017, is still hoping to take the title of ""rabba""?after her ordination this year. She told The Huffington Post that she feels the forum doesn""t reflect the diversity within the Orthodox community. She said the OU's decision has encouraged her and her colleagues to ""do our work in a more public fashion""?to raise their visibility.- ""�Visible female clergy presence in Orthodox synagogues lends validity to women's participation, gives voice to the women's side and creates a welcoming space and role models for women of all ages in our synagogues,""?Jaffe told The Huffington Post. ""Let us not deprive the Orthodox world of what these talented and dedicated women have to offer!""?,-1""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The daughter of a caliph, Wallada eventually inherited her father's palace and transformed it into a literary hall where she'dmentor young women of all backgrounds in poetry and the arts. Her poems mixed themes of spiritual worship and erotic yearning ""?sometimes exalting her beloved, other times scolding the lovers who had done her wrong. She wrote: ""I am made for higher goals and by Allah I am going my way with pride. I allow my lover to touch my cheek And bestow my kiss to him who craves it.""When Irish born, London-based actress R��is��n O'Loughlin unexpectedly encountered Wallada's poems last year, she was struck by how contemporary they felt. ""they read like the best pop lyrics,""?O'Loughlin said in a statement. ""Short and sweet in their intense defiance, desire, lovesick longing, pride and fun.""?In an email to The Huffington Post,-O'Loughlin said they reminded her of the songs of contemporary songstress FKA Twigs, who infuses her erotic lyrics with hints of spiritual reverence.- Astounded by her discovery, O'Loughlin began to research other women poets from the ancient Arab world. She landed upon the collection of Abdullah al-Udhari, comprised of verses written by women between the 7th and 12th centuries. Like Wallada, the other ancient poets spun verses that praised pleasures both carnal and divine with the same fearless breath.-One piece by 11th-century poet Itimad al-Rumaykiyya reads: ""I urge you to come faster than the wind to mount my breast and firmly dig and plough my body, and don""t let go until you're flushed me thrice.""?Lyrics like these ""?lavish and unapologetic ""?contradict the persistent, patriarchal myths that cast women, and especially women of Muslim faith, as submissive or silent. These ancient Arabic poets revealed that for millennia, women of various backgrounds, classes and faiths have expressed their feelings and beliefs in no uncertain terms, through passages that vibrate with conviction and lust, sometimes directed toward another person, and alternately, toward life itself.- ""I was really attracted to the poems, in part, because they didn""t have any agenda,""?O'Loughlin told HuffPost. ""Today the idea of empowerment is sold to us. It's become an advertising tool used to sell dresses or soap. These artists, their way of speaking, just felt really free. They felt like celebrations of life.""?Inspired by these visionary poets whose words still resonate centuries later,-O'Loughlin brainstormed how to usher this little-known pocket of ancient, erotic feminist literature into contemporary discussions, in a time so many of the stereotypes regarding femininity, Islam and the Arab World still persist. She decided to match present-day artists with their poetic predecessors, inviting women of today to create visual testimonies to accompany the written works that came before them.- O'Loughlin collected 24 total poems from Arabic women poets ""?most are Muslim, though one is Jewish and one predates Islam. She recruited two female contemporary artists from different cultural and artistic traditions to craft an artistic responses to each poem. The resulting exhibition, called ""radical Love: Female Lust,""?features 48 artworks made by women around the world, approximately half of whom are of Arab descent. Hailing from countries including Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, America, Pakistan and Ghana, the featured artists use ancient Arabic poetry as a point of departure, visualizing desire and worship in a dizzying array of manifestations.- The show will take place at the Crypt Gallery in London, a former burial ground located beneath a church. According to O'Loughlin, ""Here the words of these poets who have been silenced are given voice again, and in doing so the desire for life that is present in the female rises in the work of the modern artist.""?The curator funded the entire exhibition herself, and is currently crowdfunding on Generosity to help with the cost. She hopes to earn enough to divide all proceeds from the show between the participating artists and the Global Fund for Women,-helping Syrian refugees who have relocated to Lebanon.- The image above, a print by by Saudi artist Hend al-Mansour, was inspired by the poet Juml, a young Bedouin woman who, in 9th-century Iraq, served as a concubine to poet Idris Ibn Abi Hafsah. Al-Mansour riffed off the style of the Arabic storybook Maqamat Badi""?al-Zaman al-Hamadhani,-adding splashes of neon pink and her heroine's salty expression.- Another work, by Dublin-based photographer Deborah Sheedy titled ""I Keep my Passion to Myself,""?was inspired by a poem by Zahra. Her airy, black-and-white photo depicts a woman spinning in a white dress, appearing like something between an embodied human and imagined chimera. The photo-""?blurred and bubbling from the edges ""?transforms what photographers often construe as mistakes into opportunities for additional experimentation and play.- The motley assemblage of artists have a few things in common:-urgency, a desire to express core emotions like strength, vulnerability and love. ""they are a deliberate and timeless resistance to the silencing and patronizing of females,""?O'Loughlin added. ""Whatever external restraints were placed on these women, they retained a vitality and independence of spirit, a powerful tonic to these troubling times.""O'Loughlin originally began researching ancient Arabic poetry in 2015 -Before Brexit, before Trump's election, and before the president's-executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations. Islamophobia and the xenophobic myths that such thinking engenders were palpable then. ""I was shocked by Brexit and I was shocked by Donald Trump being elected,""?she said. ""But I was aware that people were being reduced to their ethnicity or their faith.""?Through her exhibition, O'Loughlin hoped to reveal the futility of defining human beings through such sweeping labels,-demonstrating the depth and difference that exist within every cultural category.- ""It's crazy that the word ""Muslim""?is being described to define millions of people who are from different places and cultures,""?O'Loughlin continued. ""people from Pakistan or Palestine or Algeria come from such distinct cultures. And every single woman has a different relationship to God.""?Subsequently, the featured artists in her exhibition do not disclose their faiths alongside their work. That, O'Loughlin expressed, is an aspect of themselves they are not compelled to explain to anyone. ""they are women and artists, that's all they have to be.""?Radical Love: Female Lust-is on view Crypt Gallery, St Pancras, London from Feb. 14 through March 5. The show will raise money for The Global Fund for Women helping Syrian refugees.-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,2017/2/7,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/renee-fisher/a-valentine-for-potus_b_14631164.html,A Valentine For POTUS,,"Dear POTUS, This year, I'm sending you a Valentine, not because I love you or respect you, but because I love my country. And you are the duly-elected symbol of that country. You may not know that I love my country, since I'm not in the pro-life movement, I don't attend church, fear immigrants, or verbally wave the flag every chance I get. I'm not even Christian, which I suspect is becoming ground zero for patriotism. In fact, I pretty much don't fit any of the recent descriptions used for those who love our country. My love of country stems, instead, from deep, unwavering gratitude. Gratitude that my parents were allowed to emigrate here, and that this country made room for them. Gratitude that I was given a childhood that was dramatically different than theirs. Gratitude that my life choices were those of people who have enough food to eat, a home to live in, and a government that protects them and not hunts them down. I had only to decide which clothes to wear for school that day, which homework assignment should be done first, and which children's shows I would look forward to seeing on TV over the weekend. These were decisions my parents never got to consider when they were growing up. I also love my country because my experience growing up was that people of different religions living together was entirely normal. My friends were Jewish, Protestant, Catholic. We attended the same school, borrowed books from the same library, watched movies on Saturday morning at the same theater. My parents did not experience this. Because of their religion, they lived only where the government allowed them to live. Their lives were so insular that they never learned the languages of the countries in which they lived. This is what I'd like you to understand, that, because of who I am and because of the circumstances of my family history, I love my country. You and I speak the same language, and we may use the same terms, but I may mean something a bit different than you when I do so. For example: pro-life: My belief is that life is sacred, and that being pro-life means that we have an obligation to those, like my parents, who seek asylum within our borders. And we have an obligation to those who live here now, to be inclusive. Pro-life means not shutting them out, either economically, socially, or educationally. I do not believe that they are here to suck us dry or kill us. I believe they are, like my parents, here to have a chance at a better life. ""radical Islamic terrorism"": a favorite term of yours. You'll be happy to know that I believe radical Islamic terrorism exists and that it is a threat to us and to the world. I also believe radical non-Islamic terrorism exists. It has resulted in Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing, Dylann Roof and the Charleston Church shooting, Adam Lanza and the Newtown School shooting, Charles Roberts and the Amish school shooting, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and the Columbine High School massacre. The list goes on and on. Terrorism, no matter its motivation, is unacceptable. ""government-run education monopoly"" Democracies depend on the educational system they provide their citizens. Corporations that are monopolies have consumers at their mercy, and may set prices to increase profit. They don't have to consider the welfare of the people who use their products or services. Education, as a monopoly, ensures that common standards are upheld. They are beholden to the people who use their services. There is a big difference between a business and an educational system. People of means will always have the option of sending their children to private school, just as people of faith will always have the option of sending their children to faith-based school. And people will (and should) have the option of home-schooling or sending their children to charter schools. But none of these alternatives should impact in any way whatsoever on the public school system that the vast majority of Americans attend. Alternatives mean choice, not the standard. ""fake news"": I agree wholeheartedly that fake news exists. But, in this era of unlimited avenues in which people can gather information, it's irresponsible to accept any news (no matter where it comes from) without checking sources. If you limit yourself solely to one source or one way of thinking, you become vulnerable to manipulation. And that is a very dangerous place to be. A free society is based on a free press. It is not up to any leader of this country to decide what people should read and/or listen to. It is up to us, the people,to do due diligence to weed through news sources, in order to make ourselves better-informed citizens. I also have definitions that differ from yours, regarding what it would take to ""make America great again"" and ""make the inner cities safe"" and ""keep our borders safe."" I will happily share them with you, if you'd like. So, here's your Valentine, POTUS, from a grateful-to-be-here patriot of this amazing country. I suspect that no matter what path you choose to lead this country down for the foreseeable future, I will make my opinion known. I will continue to exercise the right that was not given to my parents. And I will continue to love this country as much as anyone possibly can and to get chills whenever I say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38895007,Brexit rebellion avoided after 'meaningful vote' offer,The government has seen off an attempt to add conditions to its Brexit bill as a Conservative rebellion was avoided.,"The government has seen off an attempt to add conditions to its Brexit bill as a Conservative rebellion was avoided. MPs rejected a bid by Labour's Chris Leslie to force the government to consult Parliament on the deal struck with the EU before it is finalised. It came after ministers pledged that a ""meaningful"" vote would be offered. Labour and some Tories had pushed for MPs to have a decisive say on the final terms, but the 326 to 293 vote means the bill remains unchanged. MPs are still debating other elements of the draft legislation, which will authorise the prime minister to formally begin Brexit negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Theresa May has already promised Parliament will get a say on the final deal, but critics, including some Conservatives, said they wanted more than the ""take it or leave it"" vote being offered. Any possibility of a Conservative rebellion appeared to be halted by comments from Brexit Minister David Jones. Mr Jones said MPs would get a say on the final draft Brexit agreement before it was voted upon by the European Parliament. ""This will be a meaningful vote,"" he told MPs. ""It will be the choice of leaving the EU with a negotiated deal or not."" However, some MPs questioned whether any concessions had in fact been offered. Asked what would happen if Parliament rejected the Brexit deal or if there was no agreement with the EU to vote upon, Mr Jones said that in each scenario the UK would still leave the EU but ""fall back on other arrangements"". This would effectively see the UK default to World Trade Organization trade rules, involving potential tariffs on exports and imports. Opponents of Brexit have said this would cause real damage to British business, but supporters say the UK can live with the consequences if necessary as the UK would then be free to negotiate its own trade arrangements. Mr Jones said the government wanted to avoid a situation in which ministers were sent back to the negotiating table to hammer out a better deal. This, he said, would be hard given the two-year limit for talks and would also be ""the surest way of undermining our negotiating position and delivering a worse deal"". Former chancellor Ken Clarke - the only Tory to vote against kickstarting the Brexit process last week - said Parliament should have the opportunity to shape the final deal, while former SNP leader Alex Salmond said MPs should have a genuine choice without the ""Sword of Damocles"" hanging over them. Labour's Chuka Umunna said the choice facing MPs was ""unacceptable"", Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg described it as a ""symbolic handout"" while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said MPs were being ""duped"". But Labour's font bench claimed the move as a ""significant victory"" in response to its repeated demands for a ""meaningful"" vote at the end of the two-year negotiation process. The party withdrew its proposed amendment before Mr Leslie's was defeated. MPs, who overwhelmingly backed the European Union Bill last Wednesday, are currently in the middle of three further days of more detailed debate, with the Commons looking at amendments proposed by MPs. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who backed the Remain side in last year's EU referendum, has ordered his MPs to support the government's bill, whether his party's amendments are accepted or not. If passed by Parliament - with the House of Lords due to scrutinise it after the Commons - the bill would allow Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting divorce talks with the EU under way. Mr Corbyn argues that it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people, as expressed in last June's EU referendum. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has vowed to oppose the bill unless Labour amendments are passed in the Commons. Frontbench members of parties are generally expected to resign from their post if they ignore a three-line whip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38889941,Speaker John Bercow defends his comments on Donald Trump,Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended voicing his opposition to Donald Trump addressing Parliament.,"Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended voicing his opposition to Donald Trump addressing Parliament. His comments, including accusing the US president of ""racism and sexism"", had been made ""honestly and honourably"" and were within his remit, he told MPs. Several Conservatives have criticised the Speaker, one saying his career could be in ""jeopardy"" and another that he had damaged the national interest. Downing Street called his comments ""a matter for Parliament"". The US president has accepted an invitation from the Queen for a state visit to the UK, which can include an address to both Houses of Parliament, later this year. However, responding to a point of order in the Commons on Monday, Mr Bercow said he was opposed to Mr Trump speaking to MPs and peers - as some other international leaders have done. He said it was ""not an automatic right"", but an ""earned honour"", to applause from Labour and SNP MPs. Questioned in the Commons on Tuesday about his remarks, he replied: ""The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters."" He added: ""I was honestly and honourably seeking to discharge my responsibilities to the House."" Mr Bercow said it was time ""to move on to other matters"". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said there had been a ""rather subdued aspect"" among his party's MPs when Mr Bercow had spoken. He added: ""I do hope that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality, because that's the way for the House to proceed."" The ""relationship between the United Kingdom and United States is an extremely important one"", Sir Gerald also said. However, Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Commons owed Mr Bercow ""a debt of gratitude for deciding that in this case such an invitation should not be supported by this House."" And SNP MP Alex Salmond, who had several run-ins with Mr Trump when he was Scottish First Minister, told Mr Bercow: ""If ever a statement deserved clapping, then yours did yesterday."" Mr Bercow is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall - where Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama spoke in 2011 - along with the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster. All three must agree in order for an address to take place there. Lord Fowler addressed peers on Tuesday, saying Mr Bercow had not informed him ahead of voicing his opinion on Mr Trump, adding that Mr Bercow had told him he was ""genuinely sorry"" for this. He added: ""I don't intend to argue the case for or against Mr Trump's visit. That's not my role as Speaker. ""But let me say I have spent the last 30 years campaigning against discrimination, particularly against LGBT people and people with HIV/Aids."" As speaker, Mr Bercow is the highest authority of the House of Commons and must remain politically impartial. Several senior Conservatives have been highly critical of his comments. One unnamed Tory MP and former cabinet member told the BBC he ""must be close to standing down"" as Speaker, while another said his remarks had gone ""way beyond what is acceptable"". Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said: ""When he loses support for what was a very partisan moment I think his position will become more and more in jeopardy."" Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Bercow was going to have to deal with ""the consequences"" of his comments. He added that the Speaker, ""who's meant to referee all of this, should keep himself above that"". What is a state visit? Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told Sky News: ""It was a performance, it was John Bercow playing to the gallery and I think it was damaging to the national interest. I think it is regrettable that he did it."" Fellow Conservative Nadhim Zahawi, who has been critical of Mr Trump's travel ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries, said the Speaker prided himself on his neutrality and to become the story was ""a bad place to be"". He said Mr Bercow had opened himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after allowing other controversial leaders, like the Chinese president, to speak, and urged him to explain his thinking to MPs. Meanwhile, Joe Wilson, a Congressman for Mr Trump's republican Party, told the BBC's Newsnight programme Mr Bercow's interjection had been ""very disappointing"". ""If ever in recent years there's been a more pro-British president of the United States, it's Donald Trump,"" he said. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bercow had ""abused his position"" and that to have expressed his opinions in the way he did ""devalues this great office"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has called for the state visit to be postponed, welcomed the intervention, while Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was ""not welcome"". A petition to withdraw the invitation to the US president - and another one backing the visit - will be debated by MPs later this month. No date for Mr Trump's visit has been announced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stansted said the flight from Lahore to Heathrow had landed in Essex at 14:50 GMT after being escorted by Typhoons. Essex Police said the diversion had been due to reports of a disruptive passenger and was ""not believed to be a hijack situation or terror matter"". In an unrelated matter, a passenger due to be arrested by police on arrival at Heathrow was held at Stansted instead. The Met said the 52-year-old had been arrested on suspicion of committing fraud offences in the UK and was being transferred to a London police station. The Airbus A330 was held away from the airport after its diversion and Pakistan International Airlines said passengers were provided with ""surface transport"" to London. Stansted remained open as usual throughout the incident. An Essex police spokesman said: ""An aircraft was diverted to Stansted Airport at around 3pm this afternoon while over UK airspace en route to Heathrow Airport due to reports of a disruptive passenger on board. ""The plane is currently at the airport and officers are making enquiries. There is no disruption to the ongoing operation of Stansted Airport."" However, Pakistan International Airlines said in a statement that UK authorities had received ""some vague security threat through an anonymous phone call"" regarding the flight. Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority tweeted: ""#PIA flight bound for Heathrow from Lahore has been diverted to #Stansted due to reasons aboard the aircraft."" The RAF confirmed that Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft had been scrambled from RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire. Stansted is a designated airport for dealing with hijacks and major security alerts. Such incidents are dealt with in a remote part of the airfield to the north-west of the terminal building.

Ian Stewart, 56, denies murdering his fiancee and dumping her body in order to inherit her money. Mr Stewart broke down in tears as he told jurors there was ""no way"" he was responsible for killing the Electra Brown writer. St Albans Crown Court heard he sent her texts while she was missing, begging her to return. Mr Stewart is accused of drugging and probably suffocating his bride-to-be as part of a plot to acquire her riches. He was repeatedly overcome by emotion as he recalled the early days of their relationship, saying: ""We totally clicked and worked together as a couple."" The 51-year-old writer was last seen on 11 April and reported missing by Mr Stewart on 15 April. She was found beneath the garage, together with that of her dachshund Boris, on 15 July. Mr Stewart denied knowing she had died until her body was found in a cesspit, Simon Russell Flint, defending, asked him: ""Did you have any knowledge of her death until you heard her body had been found?"" ""No,"" he replied. When it was suggested he had killed his fiancee, he responded: ""No way"". The former software engineer said he first met Ms Bailey on a Facebook group for widowers and widows following the death of his wife in 2010. The pair started out comforting each other over their losses - Ms Bailey's first husband drowned in 2011 - but eventually began a relationship. ""We totally clicked and worked together as a couple,"" he told the court. ""I had fallen in love with her quite quickly but she warned me once to never say the L word. But then I went to hug her and I said it and she replied instantly, 'I love you too'. ""I never stopped loving her."" The prosecution alleges Mr Stewart murdered Northumberland-born Ms Bailey for her money. She was worth more than ?3.3m at the time of her death, the court heard. They also allege he disposed of her phone. Mr Stewart, of Baldock Road, Royston, also denies preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice.

75,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38897507,Education nominee Betsy DeVos wins Senate confirmation vote,"The US Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump's controversial nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, by the slenderest possible margin.","The US Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump's controversial nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, by the slenderest possible margin. US Vice-President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote to secure her cabinet role, splitting the chamber 50-50. It was the first time ever that a vice-president has interceded in such a way for a cabinet secretary. Mrs DeVos, a billionaire who has no experience with public schools, faced a rocky confirmation hearing last month. Moments after voting ended, she tweeted: ""I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. ""Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students."" Senate Democrats staged a 24-hour debate into Tuesday to hold up her confirmation. They hoped their all-night speaking marathon would pressure more Republican senators to oppose the nomination, but their efforts were in vain. Mr Pence was also the first vice-president to cast a deciding vote in the Senate since 2008, when Dick Cheney voted on a tax adjustment plan. No Democrats voted in favour of Mrs DeVos. Two Republican senators stood by their plan to oppose her confirmation, leaving the Senate in a deadlock. In the end Donald Trump is going to get the team he wants. Betsy DeVos's education secretary nomination looked a bit shaky for a while, but no Republican senator was willing to be the third ""no"" vote that would have sunk her. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ties to Russia made some conservatives uneasy, and prompted sharp questioning from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, but the former oil magnate's party closed ranks behind him. The only real question mark left is labour secretary nominee Andrew Puzdner, whose confirmation hearings have been postponed four times amid reports that he has not fully disentangled himself from his sprawling fast-food business empire. If he withdraws, however, it will be quietly, before a confrontation with Democrats heats up. Democrats always faced an uphill battle in bringing down any of Mr Trump's cabinet nominees, given the mathematical reality of being in the Senate minority. Republicans were loath to deal an early, embarrassing setback to the new president, possibly earning his long-term enmity. The fight over Mrs DeVos and other nominees has engaged the Democratic base, however. Now the question is whether they will stay engaged in the months and years ahead - or if this initial surge of activism will recede over time. Critics say Mrs DeVos, who advocates for charter schools, is not qualified to run the Department of Education. She faced intense scrutiny before a Senate committee in January, when she made headlines for noting that a Wyoming school might need a gun to defend against grizzly bears. Labour unions, rights groups and teaching organisations have also spoken out against her nomination. Groups including the American Federation of Teachers and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights held protests against Mrs DeVos outside of Congress on Monday evening. The 59-year-old is a wealthy Republican Party donor and a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman who has long campaigned for education reform in the state. Her husband Dick DeVos was a chief executive of the beauty and nutrition giant Amway and her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial private security company Blackwater. She is among several of Mr Trump's cabinet picks whom Democrats have been trying to block from being approved. Democrats said in January they would target eight of Mr Trump's nominees based on their lack of qualifications and policy positions. Before Mrs DeVos' approval, just six of Mr Trump's cabinet picks had been confirmed, compared with former President Barack Obama's 12 cabinet secretaries at this point in 2009 and 16 of George W Bush's in 2001, according to the Washington Post. The slowed process is also partly due to the fact that some of Mr Trump's picks have not completed a lengthy vetting process typically required of Cabinet candidates, which helps identify potential conflicts of interest. Hundreds of staff positions also remain vacant as the fate of 15 of Trump administration's nominees hangs in the balance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

77,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38884601,More affordable housing promised in White Paper,"The government has vowed to build more affordable houses and help people buy and rent, after admitting the current market is ""broken"".","The government has vowed to build more affordable houses and help people buy and rent, after admitting the current market is ""broken"". The new housing strategy for England includes giving councils powers to pressurise developers to start building on land they own. Ministers also pledged to make renting more ""family-friendly"" with longer tenancies offered. Labour called the measures announced ""feeble beyond belief"". The government says at least 250,000 new homes are needed each year to keep pace with demand and councils and developers need to ""get real"" to the scale of the challenge. Mr Javid set out the details of the housing White Paper in a statement to MPs, with measures including: So-called starter homes, championed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, will be aimed at ""households that need them most"", those with combined incomes of less than ?80,000, or ?90,000 in London. Starter homes are new homes built for first-time buyers between 23 and 40 years old and sold at least 20% below market value. The maximum price after the discount has been applied is ?250,000 outside London and ?450,000 in the capital. Under the new proposals, starter home buyers will need a mortgage, ""to stop cash buyers"", and some or all of the discount will have to be repaid if the property is resold within 15 years, ""to reduce the risk of speculation"". A proposal that 20% of all larger developments had to be starter homes is to be dropped and replaced with a ""clear expectation"" that at least 10% of developments will be ""affordable home ownership units"". The 22-year-olds who bought their own home (without mum and dad's help) Ruby Willard, a recruitment consultant, and engineer Sam Bardell bought a ?182,200 two-bedroom terraced house in Havant, Hampshire, last year. They took advantage of the government's Help to Buy Isa, but to save for the ?18,000 deposit, it was a case of being ""quite tight"", she says. ""When we decided we were going to buy, I thought I'm not going to spend money elsewhere when I don't need to... ""I get commission and Sam gets overtime so we probably earn ?55,000 overall, which meant we were in a position we could borrow maybe more than people on minimum wage."" Read how other 20-somethings managed to do it Mr Javid said: ""Walk down your local high street today and there's one sight you're almost certain to see: young people, faces pressed against the estate agent's window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford. ""With prices continuing to skyrocket, if we don't act now, a whole generation could be left behind. We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. ""The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live."" Mr Javid admitted there was ""no one single magic bullet"" and there had to be a ""proper conversation about housing need"". Ministers have admitted the government is behind schedule in its efforts to build one million new homes in England by 2020. For Labour, shadow housing minister John Healey said: ""We hoped for better and we needed better. His disappointment will desperately disappoint millions of people struggling to cope with a housing crisis. It was feeble beyond belief."" He added: ""We were promised a White Paper; we are presented with a white flag."" The Lib Dems criticised the ""utterly vacuous"" proposals for not mentioning the government's stated aim of a million new homes by 2020, a target ministers have insisted they are still aiming for. BBC home editor Mark Easton This government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt. The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed. Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as ""broken"" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it. But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a ""realistic plan"" to achieve that. Read more from Mark Former Conservative housing minister Grant Shapps told the BBC's Daily Politics the problem would not be solved simply ""by slotting in a few more homes in converted former industrial sites"". He added: ""Housing ministers over the years have come out with documents or bills, and the truth is none of them are going to make much difference - and I don't suppose this will make that much difference either. ""The reason is this - unless you build literally two, three, million more homes then you're not going to solve the problem."" The Local Government Association said the White Paper contained ""some encouraging signs"" on increasing housing supply and affordability. It welcomed the new ""flexibility"" around starter homes and called for new power and funding to allow councils to build affordable homes directly. The Campaign to Protect Rural England welcomed what it said was a focus on addressing current failings rather than ""meddling"" with the planning system. ""We are pleased that ministers have recognised that weakening the Green Belt is unnecessary,"" said chief executive Shaun Spiers. ""But with 360,000 houses already proposed for Green Belt land the government needs to do much more to uphold national policy and stop councils releasing it for development."" Daniel Bentley, editorial director at the think tank Civitas, said: ""The problem is not sites with planning permission standing idle, except in limited circumstances. ""It is with sites that are being developed, but too slowly to get ahead of demand and make any difference to the affordability of housing."" Graeme Brown, interim chief executive of the homelessness charity Shelter, said: ""The White Paper poses the right questions. What we need now is quick and bold action that helps people in need of a decent home tomorrow, not in 10 years."" Where can I afford to live?

Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 20, who was killed at a hostel in Queensland in August, did not die as a result of terrorism, police have said. Despite this, her death was included on a list of 78 alleged ""terror"" attacks released by the Trump administration. Rosie Ayliffe said Mia's death must not be used to persecute innocent people. How the BBC covered Trump's list of 'under-reported' terror attacks The White House released the list of attacks to back up Mr Trump's claim the media was ""under-reporting"" attacks committed or inspired by the Islamic State group. The list included the Bataclan theatre attack in Paris, the shootings in Sousse, Tunisia, which killed 30 British tourists, and Ms Ayliffe-Chung's murder. The 20 year old, from Wirksworth, died from multiple stab wounds, during the attack at Home Hill, near Townsville. Australian police have ruled out the possibility her death - which was widely reported by media in the UK and abroad - was the result of a terror attack. Mr Trump's comments come amid a legal bid by his administration to restore a travel ban on visitors and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. In an open letter to the president, Mrs Ayliffe said: ""Treating immigrants as disposable commodities and disregarding their safety causes deaths throughout our so-called civilised world."" French national Smail Ayad, 29, has been charged with the murder of Ms Ayliffe-Chung and that of Thomas Jackson, 30, from Cheshire, who was also stabbed and later died in hospital. Mrs Ayliffe added: ""The possibility of Mia and Tom's deaths being consequent to an Islamic terror attack was discounted in the early stages of the police investigation. ""This vilification of whole nation states and their people based on religion is a terrifying reminder of the horror that can ensue when we allow ourselves to be led by ignorant people into darkness and hatred."" Mr Trump has insisted ""the threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real"" and has vowed to have the travel ban reinstated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maria Mills, 51, was originally awarded ?1,100 a month from 50-year-old Graham Mills after 13 years of marriage. Appeal Court judges also ruled he should pay her ?1,441 per month as she is ""unable to meet her basic needs"". Mr Mills had argued he should not have to ""pick up the tab"" 15 years after the couple split. Lord Justice Longmore and Sir Ernest Ryder heard the couple married in 1988, had a now-grown-up son, separated in 2001 and divorced in 2002. Mr Mills, a surveyor, had agreed to give Mrs Mills, a former Notting Hill estate agent, almost all their ""liquid capital"" when they divorced, while he kept his business. His barrister, Philip Cayford, told the court Mr Mills, who now lives in Guildford, had since remarried and wanted to ""move on"" with his life. The court heard Mrs Mills had made some ""unwise"" property investments, moving from a house in Weybridge to a flat in Wimbledon, and then to an apartment in a luxury Victorian mansion block in Battersea. After selling the Battersea flat she was left ""without any of the capital"", the court was told, and was now living in a rented home in Weybridge. Mrs Mills works for two days per week as a beauty therapist, the court was told. Frank Feehan, representing Mrs Mills, said she had been left with the responsibility for the couple's young child and without enough money to buy a house that she considered ""good enough"". He said his client was ""unable to meet her basic needs"". In the ruling, Sir Ernest said Mr Mills had the ability to make the increased maintenance ""until a further order of the court"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,2017/2/7,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38894023,"Tax burden to be highest in 30 years, says think tank","Tax is set to rise as a share of the UK's income to its highest level since 1986, according to a think tank.","Tax is set to rise as a share of the UK's income to its highest level since 1986, according to a think tank. Higher income from taxes and relatively low growth will combine to create this effect, according to the the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Austerity will continue into the 2020s, after Chancellor Philip Hammond's decision to scrap a target of balancing the nation's books, it said. The Treasury said it was committed to repairing Britain's finances. Forecasts by Oxford Economics, which contributed to the report, estimate the UK economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017. In 2018, growth in gross domestic product will slow to 1.3%, Oxford Economics said. Growth is expected to be dulled as a result of inflation prompted by the decline of the value of the pound after the EU referendum. While a weaker pound is likely to improve the performance of manufacturers and exporters, higher costs for consumers will more than erase this gain, said the report. Ahmed: Public finances and the shadow of Osborne ""Though the UK economy has continued to achieve solid growth, it has been almost entirely reliant on the consumer,"" said Andrew Goodwin, lead UK Economist at Oxford Economics and co-author of part of the report. ""With spending power set to come under significant pressure from higher inflation and the welfare squeeze, the consumer will not be able to keep contributing more than its fair share. Exports should be a bright spot, but overall a slowdown in GDP growth appears likely."" The UK's economy could be 3% smaller by 2030 than if Britain had voted Remain, according to forecasts in the IFS's annual Green Budget. This annual analysis, ahead of next month's Budget, says spending on health, social care and benefits for sick or disabled people represents a particular risk to the public finances because it accounts for almost one third of government expenditure. The report confirms that the period between 2009 and 2014 saw the slowest rate of growth in health spending in England since the mid-1950s. And it argues that health budgets by the end of this decade will be over a billion pounds less than what is needed to cope with England's growing and ageing population, regardless of what are likely to be significant rises in demand for NHS care. In a statement, the Treasury said: ""The government is committed to repairing the public finances and living within our means so that we can build an economy that works for all. ""That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers' money."" Spending on public services dropped by 10% since 2010, the report said, after adjusting the figures for inflation. To meet his target of eliminating the deficit during the next parliament, which is from 2020 to 2025, Mr Hammond will probably have to find a further ?34bn in tax rises and spending cuts, extending austerity. The report said ?17bn of tax rises could be needed to contribute to closing the gap for government between outgoings and income.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Juan Jasso was verbally attacked and had beer thrown at him for tackling the trio for using foul language on the Metrolink tram on 28 June. Jobless Robert Molloy, 20, of no fixed address, was jailed for six months for abusing Mr Jasso and two other men. Sentencing of Aaron Cauchi, 19, was adjourned over illness while a boy, 16, was given a six-month referral order. The court heard the trio had been drinking all night when they went on a ""rampage"" and abused Mr Jasso and two other people in separate incidents. Their abuse of Mr Jasso was filmed by a passenger and widely viewed. Trouble began at 07:45 BST when a passenger heard ""disgusting, vile abuse"" on the tram packed with mothers with babies, schoolchildren and commuters, the court heard. Joseph O'Connor, prosecuting, told the court the trio then got off the tram and surrounded another man, ""with their chests stuck out and shoulders back, striking him with a cigarette lighter to intimidate him"". Shortly afterwards another man was cycling to work when he passed the trio and one or more spat at him, the court heard. Molloy pleaded guilty to racially aggravated assault, common assault and using threatening words or behaviour. Jailing Molloy, chair of the bench Michael Evans told him: ""Hopefully on your release from prison a lesson will be learned and you will be able to make a positive contribution and treat people with respect."" Molloy was also banned from using Greater Manchester trams for two years. Cauchi, of Spa Crescent, Little Hulton, Salford, who admitted to using threatening words or behaviour to Mr Jasso and another man and an assault on a third man, was taken from the court in an ambulance to hospital after complaining of stomach pains. It is not known when he will be sentenced. The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, received a six-month referral on Monday. He was charged with using threatening words or behaviour and common assault.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lisa Murphy, 39, had a termination in the summer of 2015 after a relationship with Cipriani, 29, the court heard. But when she was forced to miss work, due to complications, she asked him for money, which he did not pay. Murphy enlisted her colleague, Violet Smith, 29, for help and they threatened to go to the papers with the story. Murphy from Wootton, Northampton, and Smith of Slough, Berkshire, were handed a 22-month sentence suspended for two years at Kingston Crown Court. The Wasps fly-half - who was playing for Sale Sharks at the time - had offered to pay for the abortion but Murphy refused, insisting she could have the procedure for free on the NHS, the court heard previously. But when she experienced a health scare following the procedure and was unable to work, she became ""increasingly frustrated, increasingly upset, and increasingly desperate"", her lawyer, Hannah Duncan, said. Judge Peter Lodder noted while Cipriani had ""repeatedly"" offered to help, he ""did not act according to his earlier promises"". He said: ""Certainly he does not appear to have fully appreciated the extent of your difficulties"". Judge Lodder said Murphy was ""feeling increasingly desperate and was continuing to suffer from the emotional consequences of her condition"". Nigel Mitchell, representing Smith, said the pair had been offered ?18,000 for their story by The Sun but intended to resolve the situation with the former England player and continued to message him between September and October 2015. He said: ""Ms Smith's intention was to try and resolve matters. Like her co-defendant, not for a second did she consider her action and behaviour was amounting to a criminal offence."" Judge Lodder added that Smith was ""motivated by concern"" for her friend. ""It is against that background that the threat to go to the newspapers was made,"" he told the court. Describing how both defendants had since lost their jobs, he commented: ""It is an understatement to say that nobody has come out of this episode well.""

92,2017/2/6,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/38877149,Southern rail: Could drivers reject deal?,"""It's two weeks of my life I'll never get back. But we finally got there.""","""It's two weeks of my life I'll never get back. But we finally got there."" Bizarrely, the bosses of both sides said exactly the same thing to me when I interviewed them last week, moments after they'd announced a deal to resolve the worst of the Southern rail strikes. Mick Whelan from Aslef and Nick Brown from GTR (Southern's parent company) looked shattered but pleased with their agreement. But was everyone cracking the champagne corks too soon? Aslef's 1,000 or so drivers still need to vote on the deal and there are possible signs that they might just kick it out. I spoke to a couple of Southern's train drivers over the weekend and they were not happy. One wrote this to me: ""GTR, 'We will agree to carry on doing exactly what we want.' Aslef, 'OK, we'll agree to that then.'"" He went on: ""I'm very much of the opinion it will be a resounding 'no' vote (when members vote). The feeling is the union has sold us out."" Another driver also said that everyone he'd spoken to will vote no to the deal, again saying that they felt let down and that the company had got away with it. He even suggested that some of his colleagues might leave Aslef and join the RMT union instead. The RMT is still in dispute with Southern over the same issue and was vitriolic about the deal over the weekend. True, this is just the opinion of two drivers who've been chatting to their colleagues. But it suggests some anger at what they are being asked to sign up to. I understand that there is going to be a meeting in Brighton on Tuesday, where Aslef reps will try to sell the deal to members. It's bound to be frosty. All of this doesn't necessarily mean that Aslef's drivers will vote against the agreement. When I interviewed Mick Whelan last week he told me: ""I'm not in the habit of making deals that my members don't like."" Then there are the London members who already use driver-only-operated trains and may not feel as strongly over this crunch issue. Plus, Aslef doesn't pay members during industrial action, and the double whammy of losing strike-day pay plus overtime may be enough to cut their appetite for a fight. If the drivers do vote against the deal though, it's hard to see where the next breakthrough in this dispute might come. If two weeks of ""incredibly intense"" negotiation at the TUC can't solve it, what can? Presumably, Aslef would be forced to call more crippling strikes, which would also turn up the heat on the government to take over either part or all of this troublesome, complex behemoth of a franchise. I can tell you, ministers are not keen to seize control. Meanwhile, the RMT union, which represents the guards/conductors, has vowed to keep fighting. Their strikes don't have the same impact as Aslef's, with the last one only knocking out around 30% of services. But even that might change if their angry Aslef colleagues decide not to cross picket lines. Anyway, we should know all on 16 February when the ballot result comes back. The worst may not be over for beleaguered Southern passengers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,2017/2/6,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38650976,Why the falling cost of light matters,"Back in the mid-1990s, an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light.","Back in the mid-1990s, an economist called William Nordhaus conducted a series of simple experiments with light. First, he used a prehistoric technology: he lit a wood fire. But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hi-tech equipment with him - a Minolta light meter. He burned 20lb (9kg) of wood, kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim, flickering firelight with his meter. Next, he bought a Roman oil lamp, fitted it with a wick, and filled it with cold-pressed sesame oil. He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down, again using the light meter to measure its soft, even glow. Bill Nordhaus's open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood. But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day, and more brightly and controllably. Why did he do this? He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb. But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists: how to keep track of inflation, the changing cost of goods and services. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. To see why this is difficult, consider the price of travelling from - say - Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola. When that journey was first made, by Portuguese explorers, it would have been an epic expedition, possibly taking months. Later, by steam ship, it would have taken a few days; then, by plane, a few hours. An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship, but once an air route has opened up, which price do you look at? Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing. But flying is a different service - faster, more convenient. If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled. It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters. He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination. Light is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours. A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns. A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that. Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days. Those 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light. That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead. Of course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals. If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up. Thousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon. Their light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive. In a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles. Six months later, he noted: ""Candles all gone."" And those were the summer months. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the clean-burning paraffin wax candles we use today. The wealthiest could afford beeswax, but most people - even the Harvard president - used tallow candles, stinking, smoking sticks of animal fat. Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re-dipping wicks into the molten lard. It was pungent and time-consuming work. According to Prof Nordhaus's research, if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles - or earning the money to buy them - that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening. Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded. Candles were made of spermaceti - the milk-hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales. American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong, white light they gave off, and the way they ""may be held in the hand, even in hot weather, without softening"", and noted that they ""last much longer"". While the new candles were pleasing, they were also pricey. George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him ?8, or well over $1,000 (?820) in today's money. A few decades later, gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs. They also saved the sperm whale from extinction. But they, too, were basically an expensive hassle. They dripped, smelt and set fire to things. Then something changed. That something was the light bulb. By 1900, one of Thomas Edison's carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright, continuous illumination, 100 times as bright as a candle, for the money you could earn with our 60-hour week of hard labour. By 1920, that same week of labour would pay for more than five months' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs. By 1990, it was 10 years. A couple of years after that, thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs, it was more than five times longer. The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years. And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper. Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create. It would have taken Benjamin Franklin's contemporaries all afternoon. But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second. And of course our light bulbs are clean, safe and controllable - no flicker, pig fat stink or risk of fire. The light bulb has become an icon of innovation. It has transformed our society into one where we can work, read, sew or play whenever we want to, regardless of how dark the night has become. But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500,000, far faster than official inflation statistics suggest. A thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice.

Reality Check verdict: The rules for developing green belt previously said that it was allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent. A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land. Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered. This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful. In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case."" So what has changed? There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year. The Housing White Paper says the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so.

Jenner, who first shot to fame in the US reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has been trying to trademark the name Kylie in the US. But she has been blocked by the veteran Australian pop star Minogue, best known for hits such as I Should Be So Lucky and Can't Get You Out Of My Head. After a long and heated battle, the Kylies may have reached a settlement. According to papers filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in April 2015 Jenner attempted to register the mark ""KYLIE"" in the US for ""advertising services"" and ""endorsement services"". In response, Minogue's team filed their opposition in February 2016, citing possible confusion and ""damage"" to Minogue's branding. They noted Minogue was an ""internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist"" who already owns Kylie-related trademarks in the US in several industries, as well as the website www.kylie.com. Jenner, on the other hand, was dismissed as a ""secondary reality television personality"" who had drawn criticism for her ""photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts"" on social media. The case was suspended at least twice in 2016 for settlement negotiations. On 19 January Minogue's team withdrew its opposition, which means Jenner's application could proceed. This raises the possibility that they agreed to a settlement. The BBC approached both sides, but Jenner's lawyers declined comment, and Minogue's team did not respond. The USPTO does not comment on individual cases. But meanwhile Jenner appears to have conclusively lost another battle - to trademark her full name. In November 2015, Jenner's lawyers separately tried to trademark the name ""KYLIE JENNER"" for a long list of clothing and accessories. But this was rejected in July last year. On 23 January, Jenner's team appealed against this decision. Flight attendant shares story of saving trafficking victim Why do Germans hate this football club? How to own a home in the UK by the age of 25 Last year, Jenner launched a line of cosmetics called KYLIE. According to her latest appeal, she wants to eventually have ""KYLIE JENNER"" branded clothing as well as loungewear, swimwear, and underwear. Meanwhile, Minogue owns ""KYLIE"" and other similar trademarks in perfumes and toiletries, music and sound recordings, live entertainment, jewellery, dolls and toys, and printed matter such as magazines and books. So far, Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them. She also had previously said in interviews she intends to one day produce a musical featuring her greatest hits, and owns the US trademark for ""Lucky: The Kylie Minogue Musical"". But it's more than that. Since the 1980s, Kylie Minogue has never had to go by any other name but Kylie, and her team has argued it's a fundamental part of the pop diva's identity. Even with a possible settlement, what the battle shows is that at the very least brand KYLIE is not won without a fight.

96,2017/2/6,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38877091,Do 'longest flight' records matter?,"Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland.","Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland. Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes, slightly quicker than expected. The Boeing 777-200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival - a tradition for airlines on new routes. Carriers like to talk up these records, but how are they measured and do they really matter? Longest (time) or furthest (distance) are the two key distinctions to make, but it's not as simple as it might sound. The distance between two cities doesn't vary for airlines of course, but they might choose to take alternative routes. For example, a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B. And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes. In October last year, Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic - a direction switch which added an extra 1,400km to the journey, making the 15,127km trip the longest ever non-stop flight by distance. By comparison, Qatar's new route is 14,535km. But regardless of the route, flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds. For example, Qatar's return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds. And though Air India went the ""long way round"", favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about two-and-a-half hours less than its conventional route. ""The longest flying time doesn't always correspond with the longest distance,"" says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal. ""Of course, from a passenger perspective, the flying time is probably the best measurement."" Record-breaking flights may make headlines. But new long-haul flights mean nothing if they're treated as a standalone route, says Mr Taylor. Rather, it's what a new route brings to the airline's existing network. ""On its own, it wouldn't be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha, but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe, Africa, the US or elsewhere,"" says Mr Taylor. ""In that light, even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective, it may help the economics of its wider network."" Historically, most of the major long-haul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australia's Qantas. But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar, and perhaps most notably Emirates, to expand their business very rapidly. ""It's also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other,"" says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratings.com. Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes, and the range capability of aircraft improves. Last year, for example, Qantas revealed it would fly direct between Perth and London from March 2018, a flight that will take 17 hours. The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes ""With the arrival of the 777-8X in 2022, new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set,"" says Mr Thomas. ""The 777-8X will be the ultimate long haul airliner."" But remember, for routes to be viable, they also require people to buy tickets. That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16, 17 or maybe 18 hours at a time. How long that desire will last (especially for travellers cramped up in economy) is something airlines will monitor carefully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,2017/2/6,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38881119,Taking on Trump: Is the US facing a constitutional crisis?,"Donald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism - but a ""so-called judge"" is ""making the job very difficult"".","Donald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism - but a ""so-called judge"" is ""making the job very difficult"". But the judge - in halting the president's controversial executive order on immigration - said he was making sure President Trump's actions follow the law. That sets two theoretically equal branches of the government against one another - and could bring about a crisis. The separation of powers is crucial to understanding how the US is governed. The country's constitution established its treasured system of checks and balances - where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another. The federal government's power is split into three distinct parts - the executive branch, which includes the president and his cabinet; the legislative branch, Congress, which makes the laws; and the judiciary. This works well most of the time, with each branch co-operating with the next. But with the president in open conflict with another branch, there are fears that an impasse could be reached. That could lead to a constitutional crisis - a scenario in which the situation cannot be resolved - particularly after Mr Trump seemed to openly question the judge's authority. ""The President's hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous,"" Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, from the Senate judiciary committee, said. ""He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis."" There are about 700 federal district judges in the US - the type facing down the president's order. Unlike state court judges, these men and women are part of the federal court system - along with the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals. Day to day, it's the 94 District Courts which deal with interpretation of US laws, treaties, and public officials - powers devolved to them from the Supreme Court. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made... But the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked - they only interpret law when a case is brought before them. The other two branches of government make and enforce the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is a dispute. That is the issue here - a presidential executive order has all the force of law, and is subject to the same checks. Those judicial powers have been used many times before. Barack Obama faced stumbling blocks in 2015 when he attempted to use an executive order to grant a reprieve to undocumented immigrants, and George W Bush faced similar battles over detainees in Guantanamo Bay. It is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Judge James Robart, for example - the ""so-called judge"" of Mr Trump's Twitter criticism - was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004. But Mr Trump can't fire judges. That's because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference. Only Congress can remove a federal judge from office through impeachment, which involves both the House and Senate. It is the same system used to remove a president. This ""article three"" protection is, in practical terms, very rigid. Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States. The end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire - or until death. In effect, two of the country's three branches of government are in conflict - and neither can remove the other. Inside the mind of Donald Trump Which executive actions will have the most impact? Tech world caught between Trump and a liberal place The Supreme Court, as the name implies, has ultimate power in the judiciary - the other courts are inferior to it. In this case, the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court - and may still do so. Nine seats make up the court Four were appointed by Democrats: two by President Clinton, and two by President Obama Four were appointed by Republican Presidents: George W Bush, George Bush Snr, and Ronald Reagan One seat is vacant following the death of Antonin Scalia. Just as with the other federal courts, though, the Supreme Court is protected from interference. But there are currently only eight judges on the Supreme Court. Four were appointed by a Democrat, and four by a Republican - with one vacant seat waiting to be filled by Mr Trump's nominee, which could swing the balance of power. Congress could break any deadlock that crops up between the president and the judiciary by creating a law that overturns his decision - or even impeaching a president or judge. Since Mr Trump's Republican party holds a majority there, action against the president seems unlikely. And the independence of the courts is so essential to the US way of governing, that moving to attack judges on behalf of the president would be a drastic step. Nonetheless, with two of the three powers in conflict, the decision may fall to Congress eventually - unless Mr Trump modifies his order. That may be the most prudent move, in keeping with his predecessors who have often backed off in the face of judicial opposition. For now, though, Mr Trump ""just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril"" - and shows no signs of changing his mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,2017/2/3,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38830514,Trump presidency week two: Foot still on accelerator,"President Trump's first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind. His second week has been no less hectic. Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings, the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook.","President Trump's first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind. His second week has been no less hectic. Despite the mass protests of week one and falling approval ratings, the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook. In a divided America, many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration, while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done. Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland. On Friday, a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days, banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The immediacy of the announcement, which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for ""bad dudes"" to sneak in, caused widespread confusion at airports around the world. Families were separated, and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban. An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports. Around the world, travellers were prevented from boarding planes, and in some cases, were pulled off flights. Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired. An Iran-born BBC reporter with British citizenship was among those temporarily detained. Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest, with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released. Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks. Things were working out ""very nicely"", he said. Steve Gruber, a popular talk-show host in Michigan, summed up the mood among many Trump voters. Listeners, he said, ""are encouraged that a politician, albeit a new one, is actually doing the things he said he would do"". Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented, but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings. As condemnation grew, including from a few top Republicans, many foreign governments and major US companies, the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban, pointing to the many Muslim-majority countries not involved. Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim, admitting to Fox News that Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims. He said, however, that the ban implemented was based on ""danger"", not religion. Sean Spicer, the White House's combative press secretary, blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel ""ban"", even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter. Meanwhile, the world tried to figure out the unique language on display at protests in Scotland. The immigration order's fallout dominated headlines for most of this week. ""This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House,"" our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. Amateur hour at the White House? But President Trump's supporters think he's doing a great job. The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone. In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban, acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trump's executive order. Within hours, she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of ""betraying"" her department and being ""weak on borders"". Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government. But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty. The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated. As news spread on Monday that hundreds of US diplomats around the world were planning to use a ""dissent channel"" to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer, Sean Spicer said ""they should either get with the programme or they can go"". That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views. On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony, Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court - Judge Neil Gorsuch, of Colorado. The Democrats, whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity, have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate. The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights. Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago, the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices, at four each. Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant, though justices don't always split on clear ideological lines. Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice, but the Republicans didn't allow it given an election was forthcoming. Like the late Mr Scalia, the Ivy-League educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. Who is Neil Gorsuch? Why is the US Supreme Court so important? House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee ""a very hostile appointment"" and ""a very bad decision, well outside the mainstream of American legal thought"". And of course, there were more protests. Stephen Bannon, Donald Trump's chief strategist, is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks. The former executive chairman of populist, conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a ""rumpled right-wing agitator"" by the New York Times. On Saturday night, he was given a seat on the National Security Council's inner circle, or principals' committee. Under the restructuring, the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas. The move shocked many Washington veterans. ""It's completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group,"" Eliot Cohen, director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told the BBC. Mr Bannon has a ""destructive"" world view and has accumulated an ""unhealthy"" level of power, he said, describing it as an ""ominous"" move. What exactly is his destructive world view? Well, according to the Daily Beast, in 2013 Bannon said he wanted ""to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's establishment"". The White House tried to brush the changes off, pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrod had been included in some council meetings. Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as ""Darth Vader"" in a recent interview where he described US media as ""the opposition party"". Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security, and thus global stability, are discussed at a very, very senior level. Refugees are very much on President Trump's radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals. But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM, which was scheduled to last for an hour, was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes. President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull, in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations, was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders. In fact, the Washington Post reported that Mr Trump described the conversation as ""the worst by far"". He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter - a deal struck with the Obama administration which would see up to 1,250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US. What next? President Trump was so worked up after discussing ""the worst deal ever"" that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner - via Twitter. Mr Trump tweeted that he would ""study this dumb deal"". Later, Mr Spicer gave an official version of his boss's 25-minute call with Mr Turnbull. He said that both leaders had ""emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship"". Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal. Trump's first week: Well, that was intense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,2017/2/3,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38856081,Should you have two bins in your bathroom?,"Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with.","Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles's Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? ""It's trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,"" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. ""Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,"" it says. ""This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space."" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. ""But it doesn't have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,"" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. ""The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,"" says Business in the Community. ""Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact."" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: ""There can also be confusion about what can or can't be recycled with bathroom products. ""For example many people don't realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it's empty and put the lid back on. ""Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up."" Research from the University of Exeter also found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being ""dirty"" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can't be recycled can seem off-putting,"" says Business in the Community. It added: ""There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols."" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. ""In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,"" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. ""Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,"" it added. ""For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials."" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? ""Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,"" says Recycle Now. ""It would save ?135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. ""On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times."" But what if you don't have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,2017/2/3,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38852000,Vegetable shortage: How to cope as supermarkets ration lettuces,"Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg.","Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg. Bad weather in Europe has already caused a #courgette crisis, alongside a shortage of broccoli, tomatoes, salad peppers and aubergines. With vegetable shortages expected to continue until April, what alternatives are there for shoppers? During the UK's winter months of December, January and February, UK farmers produce beetroot, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celeriac, chicory, fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, red cabbage, swede and turnips. We've become a ""slightly strange group"", expecting all-year-round produce, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Northern Foods, which supplies Tesco. ""Thirty years ago you'd never have worried about buying lettuce in the middle of the winter - lettuces were things that grew in the summer and you ate them in the summer - you ate cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts in the winter,"" he says. As for courgettes, they are actually ""very, very out of season"", says organic vegetable retailer Riverford. We have just got used to supermarkets supplying them all year round. Eating British produce that's in season is often cheaper, as it is produced locally - and it can be healthier too. According to food industry campaign group Love British Food, fruit and vegetables that are in season contain the nutrients, minerals and trace elements that our bodies need at particular times of year. Apples, for example, are packed with vitamin C to boost our resistance to winter colds. The group's Alexia Robinson recommends beetroot, kale, cabbages, broccoli and traditional root vegetables for their health-giving properties. Riverford says a slaw made with cabbage, beetroot or swede will offer ""10 times more nutrients"" than an iceberg lettuce - which it says aren't known for their nutritional value. If you are really keen on iceberg lettuces, you can probably pay a bit more for one from Peru or South Africa, says Lord Haskins. But imported vegetables can clock up a lot of air miles before they land on your plate - making them worse for the environment. Hatty Richards, from the Community Farm in Chew Magna, Somerset, says buying local is better. ""We have such a range on our doorsteps already, it's fresher, it's really good for the environment - it reduces air miles - and it supports local business which is crucial."" Lord Haskins agrees, and suggests your tastebuds may also be grateful: ""We all buy stuff from far parts. They don't taste nearly as good: strawberries at this time of year from Egypt don't taste anything like as good as a British strawberry in May, June, July."" A leafy salad is nice - but there are plenty of alternative dishes to try. Riverford's Guy Watson thinks the UK's more bitter winter salad leaves and root vegetables can provide ""a far superior substitute"" which will easily make up for a lack of lettuce. Vibrant winter coleslaws and cauliflower salads ""bring British veg to life"", he says, adding that one of the Riverford Field Kitchen's most popular winter dishes is a kale caesar salad. Kale, which was originally used to feed cows, is a robust, hardy winder leaf that can withstand frosty weather. It can also be used in soups, stews, stir fries, gratins or just wilted with butter. For Ms Robinson suggests embracing winter comfort food with a ""good old fashioned winter stew with plenty of root vegetables with tender meat"". If you're still not convinced you can do without leafy salads, try growing your own. Those who do want to eat lettuce need not despair. According to the campaign group Eat Seasonably, lettuce, rocket and other crunchy salad leaves are some of the easiest things to grow at home, all year around - on a seed tray indoors, on your window sill or in the garden. Ms Robinson says: ""As well as the cress there are many great veg that can be easily grown in window boxes such as leaf lettuce, radishes, spinach, green onions and of course a good selection of herbs."" Another easy win is beetroot, Eat Seasonably says, which can be grown in a big pot. Though beetroot is harvested in October, Riverford says it can last up to four months if it's kept in a cold storage. ""Carrots are not too hard to grow either,"" Riverford's Emily Muddeman said, ""Leeks, kale - you could plant just four or five stalks of kale and it will go on sprouting."" Any budding gardeners could start with planting onions later this month - Eat Seasonably says they are ""not even slightly difficult to grow"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
